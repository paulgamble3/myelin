    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry if it seemed like I was yelling, that was not my intention. I just want to make sure everything is clear for you. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you?\n\nPatient: Oh, gosh. I feel like everything is boring. Me,\n\nNurse: I understand that this can feel overwhelming. It's a lot to take in. I'm here to help make this process as smooth as possible for you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to proceed?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Great, let's move on to your medications. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications. However, I would like to confirm if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Are you currently taking any of these?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to avoid those medications unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Do you have any questions about your medications or anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: No. I do not.",

        "gpt4": "Alright. I'm glad to hear that everything is clear about your medication. Let's discuss the diet prep for your colonoscopy next. Beginning today, you should start eating a low fiber diet. This includes foods like white bread, pasta, and rice. Avoid foods high in fiber like whole grains, vegetables, and fruits. Your doctor wants you to eat this way to ensure the colon is clean for the procedure. Can you tell me about some low fiber foods you like to eat? Perhaps there's a comfort food you enjoy that is low in fiber?",
