    "prompt": "Nurse: That's fantastic to hear. Eating salads can be a great way to incorporate more vegetables into your diet. Could you tell me a bit more about the types of salads you've been eating?\n\nPatient: I've been using the Wishbone Italian salad dressing. How much salt is in that dressing?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, and it's wonderful to hear that you're making an effort to eat healthier. I don't have the exact sodium content of Wishbone Italian salad dressing at the moment, but I can certainly look it up for you. Would you like me to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I've found that the sodium content in Wishbone Italian salad dressing can vary depending on the specific type and size of the bottle. For example, a 2-tablespoon serving of Wishbone Italian Dressing might contain around 350 mg of sodium. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label on the bottle for the most accurate information. Does that help?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could help with that. It's critical to keep an eye on your sodium intake, especially with your conditions. Now, let's move on to discuss your other chronic conditions. How have you been managing your hypertension?\n\nPatient: Pretty well.",
