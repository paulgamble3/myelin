    "prompt": "Patient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Great, let's move on to your medications. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications. However, I would like to confirm if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Are you currently taking any of these?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to avoid those medications unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Do you have any questions about your medications or anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: No. I do not.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice. You should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: Questions.\n\nPatient: I mean, actually yeah. Like,",
