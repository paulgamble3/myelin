    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: I'm just not ready to quote yet. There's too many things going on in my life, and I don't wanna think about it right now.\n\nNurse: I completely understand. It's a big decision and it's important to be ready. Can you share more about why you feel now isn't the right time?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm changing so much about my lifestyle right now because of all my various diagnosis. So\n\nNurse: I see, managing multiple health conditions can indeed feel overwhelming. It's critical to focus on what feels manageable for you. If you ever decide you're ready to consider quitting smoking, we have a lot of resources that could help you. Would you like me to share some of these resources with you for future reference?\n\nPatient: So I figured I should focus on one at a time.\n\nNurse: That's a very thoughtful approach. It's important to feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. If you ever decide you're ready to discuss it, I have a lot of resources and information that could be helpful. Would you like me to share some of these resources with you for future reference?\n\nPatient: No. Not right. Now.",
