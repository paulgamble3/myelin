If you ever decide you're ready to consider quitting smoking, we have a lot of resources that could help you. Would you like me to share some of these resources with you for future reference?\n\nPatient: So I figured I should focus on one at a time.\n\nNurse: That's a very thoughtful approach. It's important to feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. If you ever decide you're ready to discuss it, I have a lot of resources and information that could be helpful. Would you like me to share some of these resources with you for future reference?\n\nPatient: No. Not right. Now.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. Whenever you feel ready, know that these resources are available to you. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have a question.\n\nNurse: Of course, what's your question?\n\nPatient: Due to prevent going on dialysis.",

This can include managing underlying conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, taking prescribed medications, regular check-ups with your healthcare provider, and avoiding certain medications that can harm the kidneys. Your doctor or registered dietitian may also recommend a specific diet plan for you. Does this help answer your question?",
