    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a very thoughtful approach. It's important to feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. If you ever decide you're ready to discuss it, I have a lot of resources and information that could be helpful. Would you like me to share some of these resources with you for future reference?\n\nPatient: No. Not right. Now.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. Whenever you feel ready, know that these resources are available to you. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have a question.\n\nNurse: Of course, what's your question?\n\nPatient: Due to prevent going on dialysis.\n\nNurse: To help prevent the need for dialysis, it's important to manage your kidney disease and overall health as effectively as possible. This includes taking your medications as prescribed, maintaining a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and avoiding alcohol and smoking. It's also crucial to manage your other health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, as they can impact your kidney health. Regular check-ups and lab tests can help monitor your kidney function and catch any changes early. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
