    "prompt": "Patient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to avoid those medications unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Do you have any questions about your medications or anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: No. I do not.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice. You should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: Questions.\n\nPatient: I mean, actually yeah. Like,\n\nNurse: Of course, what would you like to know?\n\nPatient: so much preparation. And how long do I have to do this little fiber. I love fiber. I love fiber. Like, I hate that you guys ask me to reduce my fiber",

        "gpt4": "I can empathize with your frustration, especially if you're used to a high fiber diet. You'll need to eat a low fiber diet three days before your procedure, so that would be starting from today. Your body needs to process foods faster than it usually does for a colonoscopy, and low fiber diet will aid in that process. After the colonoscopy, you can resume your normal high fiber diet. Do you have any favorite low fiber comfort foods you might enjoy during this time?",
        "our_model": "I understand your love for fiber, it's an important part of a healthy diet. However, in preparation for a colonoscopy, a low fiber diet is necessary to ensure your colon is as clean as possible. This helps Doctor Bailey get the most accurate results. You'll need to follow this diet until the day of your procedure. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Are there any low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?"
