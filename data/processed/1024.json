How are you doing now that you're home from the hospital?\n\nPatient: I'm doing okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. It must be a relief to be back in your own space. Is there anything in particular you're looking forward to doing now that you're home?\n\nPatient: Just happy to be back with my cat.\n\nNurse: That sounds lovely. Cats can be such comforting companions. What's your cat's name?\n\nPatient: His name is Rabis.\n\nNurse: Rabis, that's a unique name. Does he have any special habits or things he likes to do?\n\nPatient: Are you, like, biting?",

        "gpt4": "Oh, no! I heard that some cats get a little feisty when they play. Are you able to manage Rabis' playful nibbles?",
