Rabis likes to nibble on people. That's quite a character trait. Now, I have a few topics to cover with you on behalf of Doctor Jack Smith. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. Let's start with your medications. Are you still taking your Valsartan and Lasix?\n\nPatient: Yes. I am.\n\nNurse: Great. And are you also continuing with your Methotrexate?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.",
