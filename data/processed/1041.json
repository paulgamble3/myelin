Can you tell me about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: I've been needing a lot of seamed vegetables, lot of whole grain of rice,\n\nPatient: Actually wanna ask though, what kind of diet I should be following?\n\nNurse: I'm glad you asked.

Would you like me to share some specific dietary recommendations?\n\nPatient: Sure. Yeah.\n\nNurse: Okay. For your cardiac diet, you should aim to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Try to limit your intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium. For your renal diet, you should focus on foods that are low in potassium, phosphorus, and sodium. This includes fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains.
