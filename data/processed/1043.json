Try to limit your intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, and sodium. For your renal diet, you should focus on foods that are low in potassium, phosphorus, and sodium. This includes fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains. It's also important to limit your fluid intake. Based on what you've told me about your meals, it sounds like you're already making some good choices. Do you have any questions about these dietary recommendations?\n\nPatient: I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about exercise. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: And I like to go on Bye bye. Jobs a week,\n\nPatient: maybe some, like, long walks then I do a little bit of free wait listing as well.\n\nNurse: That's great. Regular exercise is important for managing your conditions. Walking and light weight lifting are good choices. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great. Since you have CHF, it's important to start slow and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your exercise. You might find it helpful to include some flexibility and stretching exercises as well. Remember to always warm up before starting your exercise and cool down afterwards. Your body will let you know if you're pushing yourself too hard. If you start to feel dizzy, short of breath, or have chest pain, take a rest. It's always a good idea to talk with your doctor before starting a new exercise program. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed?",
        "our_model": "Thank you. Given your conditions, it's important to monitor your symptoms during exercise. If you feel short of breath, dizzy, or have chest pain, it's important to stop and rest. It's also a good idea to start with light activities and gradually increase your activity level as your body allows. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed?"
