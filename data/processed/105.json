    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, what would you like to know?\n\nPatient: so much preparation. And how long do I have to do this little fiber. I love fiber. I love fiber. Like, I hate that you guys ask me to reduce my fiber\n\nNurse: I understand your love for fiber, it's an important part of a healthy diet. However, in preparation for a colonoscopy, a low fiber diet is necessary to ensure your colon is as clean as possible. This helps Doctor Bailey get the most accurate results. You'll need to follow this diet until the day of your procedure. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Are there any low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: No. Well, can you tell me? What are the little fiber foods out there?\n\nNurse: Of course, some examples of low fiber foods include white bread, pasta, and rice. You can also have lean meats like chicken or turkey, eggs, and dairy products like milk and cheese. On the other hand, you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're wondering about?\n\nPatient: No. I do not.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the next topic. You will also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.",
