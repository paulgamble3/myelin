It's quite a process to go through, but it's great that you're taking this step to take care of your health. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm, again, just ready to get it over with.\n\nNurse: I can appreciate your readiness to have it done. It's a significant step you're taking for your health. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on preparing for your colonoscopy. Is that okay?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll also have another call the day before your procedure. Let's start with your current medication. You're taking Ferrous Sulfate 200 mg once a day, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming that. Now, let's get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's fine.",
