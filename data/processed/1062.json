    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Okay. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes, please. Let's move on.\n\nNurse: Great. Regarding your medication, Ferrous Sulfate, you will need to stop taking it 5 days prior to your procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes. That makes complete sense.",
