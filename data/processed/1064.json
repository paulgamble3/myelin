    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes, please. Let's move on.\n\nNurse: Great. Regarding your medication, Ferrous Sulfate, you will need to stop taking it 5 days prior to your procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes. That makes complete sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any questions about stopping your Ferrous Sulfate medication?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.",
