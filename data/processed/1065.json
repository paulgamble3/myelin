    "prompt": "Nurse: Great. Regarding your medication, Ferrous Sulfate, you will need to stop taking it 5 days prior to your procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes. That makes complete sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any questions about stopping your Ferrous Sulfate medication?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications before we move on to discussing your diet?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Okay. Now let's transition to diet preparation for the colonoscopy. Starting from today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, seeds, nuts, raw fruits and vegetables, and instead focusing on foods like white bread, cereals, pasta, and cooked or canned fruits and vegetables without seeds or skin. Does that help you understand how to make adjustments to your diet?",
        "our_model": "Alright. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Does that make sense?"
