    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Makes total sense. Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: I I don't know pasta.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: Pasta.",

        "gpt4": "Pasta is a great choice, and it's perfect for a low fiber diet. Now, let's talk about the day before your procedure. On August 16, you will need to follow a clear liquid diet. This means no solid food. You can have things like broth, clear juices like apple or white grape, Jell-O, and popsicles that are not red or purple. Does that make sense?",
        "our_model": "Pasta is a great choice for a low fiber diet. It's versatile and can be made in many ways to keep it interesting. Do you have a favorite pasta dish that you're looking forward to having during this time?"
