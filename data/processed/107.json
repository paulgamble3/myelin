        "gpt4": "I hear you, it can certainly feel like a lot to juggle. Most people find the bowel prep to be the toughest part, but remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Let me break it down a bit. You don't have to start anything just yet. On the day before your procedure, you'll need to start a clear liquid diet. This involves drinking only clear liquids and no solid foods. You can have clear or light colored beverages, but avoid any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of clear liquids with you?",
        "our_model": "I can see how this might feel overwhelming. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?"
