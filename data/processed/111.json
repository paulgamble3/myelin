It's quite a process to go through, especially for a preventative screening like this. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Well,\n\nNurse: Yes, you were saying?\n\nPatient: I'm not not gonna die, am I?\n\nNurse: Rest assured, you're not going to die. The bowel prep and the colonoscopy procedure are both very safe. The purpose of the bowel prep is to clean out your colon so that Doctor Bailey can get the most accurate results. It's a crucial part of the process to ensure your health. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye.

        "gpt4": "Excellent, examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks without red or purple dye, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or any red coloring. These will help to keep you hydrated while also ensuring your colon is clear for the procedure. It's important to avoid any beverages with red or purple dye, as they can stain the colon and make it more difficult for the doctor to see. Do you have any queries about these clear liquid diet examples?",
