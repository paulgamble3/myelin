I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Let's move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol 500 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Fantastic. Those medications typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommends otherwise. Also, I notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone for after the procedure. Have you managed to pick up this prescription yet?",
        "our_model": "That's good to know. It's critical to avoid certain medications like blood thinners before a knee replacement unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?"
