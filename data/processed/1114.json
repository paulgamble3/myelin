    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to know. It's critical to avoid certain medications like blood thinners before a knee replacement unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I picked it up.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's important to have that on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss regarding this topic?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yep.",

        "gpt4": "That's great. Let's go over how to use the scrub. Ahead of your procedure, you will need to use this scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. After you've taken a shower as normal and turned the water off, you'll be ready to use the scrub. Does this sound okay so far?",
