    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to know. It's critical to avoid certain medications like blood thinners before a knee replacement unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I picked it up.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's important to have that on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss regarding this topic?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. The chlorhexidine scrub is an important part of preparing for your surgery. Let's go over the instructions for using it. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yep.",

        "gpt4": "Good. After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub your body from the neck down. It's important to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you manage that?",
