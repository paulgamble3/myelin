    "prompt": "Nurse: I can understand how you might feel that way. It's quite a process to go through, especially for a preventative screening like this. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Well,\n\nNurse: Yes, you were saying?\n\nPatient: I'm not not gonna die, am I?\n\nNurse: Rest assured, you're not going to die. The bowel prep and the colonoscopy procedure are both very safe. The purpose of the bowel prep is to clean out your colon so that Doctor Bailey can get the most accurate results. It's a crucial part of the process to ensure your health. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Okay. Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's critical to note that you should avoid any beverages with red or purple dye. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: You know you know what comes to mind? I know, but I don't know. I know that I know nothing.",

        "gpt4": "That's a common feeling when facing a medical procedure. It's a new experience and there's a lot to learn. That's why I'm here, to help you through this process. Would you like me to go over anything again or do you have another question on your mind?",
        "our_model": "That's okay. It's a lot to take in. I'm here to help you understand every step of the process. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?"
