Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright. Let's move on to the next question. Have you been experiencing any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure.
