    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. It's critical to have a comfortable and safe place to recover after your procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I have\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If you didn't have someone, you would still have time to arrange it, but it's good that you've already taken care of this. Do you have any questions about the discharge plan or anything else related to your procedure?\n\nPatient: No. Thanks.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling prepared. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Nope.",

        "gpt4": "Alright. To summarize, your surgery is taking place on August 13th at 9:00 AM and you need to arrive at 8:00 AM. You should continue taking your Tylenol as prescribed, and you have your Oxycodone ready for after the procedure. You've already obtained the chlorhexidine scrub and understand the instructions on how to use it. And you understand that you can't eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. You've also confirmed that you haven't been feeling ill recently, that you plan to go home after the procedure, and that you've arranged for a ride and someone to assist you afterwards. Is all of that correct? Can I count on you to remember all of these steps?",
