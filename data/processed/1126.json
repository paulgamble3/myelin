    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful. It's critical to have a comfortable and safe place to recover after your procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I have\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If you didn't have someone, you would still have time to arrange it, but it's good that you've already taken care of this. Do you have any questions about the discharge plan or anything else related to your procedure?\n\nPatient: No. Thanks.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling prepared. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright. To summarize, before your procedure, you need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
