    "prompt": "Nurse: It sounds like you're making a good effort to eat healthily, Mr. Cardenas. Focusing on vegetables and staying away from processed foods is a great start. Can you tell me more about the types of vegetables you're eating and how you're preparing them?\n\nPatient: Well, broccoli, asparagus,\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Cardenas, could you please repeat the second vegetable you mentioned?\n\nPatient: Brussels sprouts, stuff like that, salads,\n\nNurse: That's a great variety of vegetables, Mr. Cardenas. It's also good to hear that you're including salads in your diet. How are you preparing these vegetables?\n\nPatient: So if I'm preparing cooked vegetables, I usually just steam them.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Cardenas. Steaming vegetables is a great way to prepare them as it helps to retain their nutrients. Now, I'd like to remind you of your dietary recommendations. You're following a cardiac diet, which means it's important to limit sodium and unhealthy fats. Also, due to your Fanconi-Bickel disease, you're restricting Fructose and Galactose. Can I share some dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Cardenas. Here are some important points:\n\n1. You should aim to consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins such as chicken or fish.\n2. Sodium should be limited - try to keep your daily intake under 2000mg. Use herbs and spices instead of salt for flavoring. \n3. It's essential to avoid foods with high fructose corn syrup, honey, sucrose, and sorbitol due to your Fanconi-Bickel disease.\n4. Limit the intake of unhealthy fats - saturated and trans fats - found mostly in fried foods, baked goods, and processed foods.\n5. Remember to stay hydrated, but avoid sugary drinks. Choose water, unsweetened herbal tea, or other no-sugar-added beverages.\n\nWould you like more information on this, or is there another topic you'd like to discuss?",
