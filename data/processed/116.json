        "gpt4": "Alright, let me share some tips that might help in consuming the NuLYTELY laxative solution. Some people find it helpful to chill it in the fridge before drinking. Others will take it through a straw to bypass some taste buds. Taking small frequent sips can also make it more tolerable.
