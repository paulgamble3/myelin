    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great variety of vegetables, Mr. Cardenas. It's also good to hear that you're including salads in your diet. How are you preparing these vegetables?\n\nPatient: So if I'm preparing cooked vegetables, I usually just steam them.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Cardenas. Steaming vegetables is a great way to prepare them as it helps to retain their nutrients. Now, I'd like to remind you of your dietary recommendations. You're following a cardiac diet, which means it's important to limit sodium and unhealthy fats. Also, due to your Fanconi-Bickel disease, you're restricting Fructose and Galactose. Can I share some dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Cardenas. For your cardiac diet, it's important to include a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Try to limit foods high in sodium, saturated fats, and cholesterol. For your Fructose and Galactose restriction, it's important to avoid foods like fruits, honey, and certain vegetables like onions and tomatoes. Also, avoid foods with high fructose corn syrup. Does this information help you understand your dietary recommendations better?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Thank you, Rachel.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Cardenas. I'm glad I could help. Remember, making these dietary changes can have a significant impact on your health. Now, let's talk about exercise. Could you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: Well, I like to go hiking. I ride my bike. Usually, every day,",
