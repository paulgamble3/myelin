        "gpt4": "Great, thank you for allowing me to help, Mr. Cardenas. For patients with CHF, we recommend a combination of cardiovascular, strength, flexibility and balance exercises. It sounds like your current regimen of hiking, biking, and pickleball are fantastic for cardiovascular fitness and balance. For strength and flexibility, you might consider adding some gentle resistance training and stretching exercises to your routine. If you're interested, we could find a physical therapist to provide you with some specific exercises. What do you think about this?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Cardenas. It's critical to remember that with CHF, it's crucial to listen to your body. If you feel short of breath or fatigued, it's okay to slow down or take a break. Also, consider incorporating some light strength training exercises into your routine, as they can help improve your overall strength and endurance. Lastly, remember to stay hydrated and avoid extreme temperatures. Does this information help you understand how to adjust your exercise routine?"
