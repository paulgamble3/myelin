        "gpt4": "That's an excellent question, Mr. Cardenas. There's actually a strong link between oral health and heart health. Poor oral health, particularly gum disease, increases the risk of heart disease. This is because bacteria in your mouth can enter the bloodstream, causing inflammation and damage to your blood vessels, which can impact the heart. Remember, maintaining good oral hygiene is not only important for your dental health but also for your overall health. Do you have any other questions on this topic?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question, Mr. Cardenas. Oral health can indeed impact heart health. Poor oral hygiene can lead to gum disease, which has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. This is because the bacteria that cause gum disease can enter the bloodstream and contribute to the formation of plaque in the arteries, leading to heart disease. It's important to maintain good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly and visiting your dentist for regular check-ups. Does this answer your question?"
