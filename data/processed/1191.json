        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Dang. Before your colonoscopy, it's very important to follow the doctor's instructions closely. This includes taking a prescribed laxative, usually in the form of a drink, the day before your procedure. This will help cleanse your colon and ensure your doctor has a clear view during the procedure. You'll need to avoid solid food the day before your procedure and stick to clear liquids like broth, tea, or apple juice. Does this sound okay to you?",
        "our_model": "Great, thank you, Mr. Dang. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with your current medication. You're taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day, correct?"
