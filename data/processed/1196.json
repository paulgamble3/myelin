    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for confirming that, Mr. Dang. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Dang. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yep. So I'm just fine.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Dang. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. I'm glad to hear that you're comfortable with the logistics. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: I am, but you already asked about my Xarelto.",

        "gpt4": "I apologize if that was unclear, Mr. Dang. Regarding Xarelto, it's important to note that you should stop taking it 5 days before the procedure. Today being August 10, you'd need to stop this medication from August 12. Does that make sense?",
        "our_model": "I apologize for any confusion, Mr. Dang. You're correct, we did discuss your Xarelto medication. According to the instructions, you will need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?"
