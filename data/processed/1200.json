    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize for any confusion, Mr. Dang. You're correct, we did discuss your Xarelto medication. According to the instructions, you will need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Dang. Do you have any questions about stopping your Xarelto medication?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Dang. It's important to avoid those medications before your colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any other questions about your medications?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, thank you for confirming, Mr. Dang. I'd like to move on and discuss your pre-procedure diet. Starting today, it would be beneficial for you to begin eating a low fiber diet. This can help clear the intestines and make it easier for your doctor to examine your colon during the colonoscopy. You should aim to consume foods such as white bread, pasta, and canned fruits. On the other hand, you would want to avoid foods like whole grains, raw fruits, and raw vegetables. Do you have any questions regarding this dietary change?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Dang. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?"
