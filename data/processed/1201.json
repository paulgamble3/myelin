    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent, Mr. Dang. Do you have any questions about stopping your Xarelto medication?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Dang. It's important to avoid those medications before your colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any other questions about your medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: No.",
