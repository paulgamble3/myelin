    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Dang. It's important to avoid those medications before your colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any other questions about your medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Dang. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the diet instructions. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Hi, pasta.",

        "gpt4": "That's great! Pasta is a delicious low-fiber choice and perfect for your diet leading up to the procedure. Now, there's one more thing I'd like to discuss. The day before your colonoscopy, you must follow a clear liquid diet. This includes broth, tea, coffee, clear juices, and sports drinks. Is there a certain clear liquid you prefer?",
        "our_model": "I'm sorry, Mr. Dang, could you please repeat your favorite low fiber comfort food?"
