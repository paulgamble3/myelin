    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Dang. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the diet instructions. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Hi, pasta.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Dang, could you please repeat your favorite low fiber comfort food?\n\nPatient: I like pasta.\n\nNurse: Pasta is a great choice, Mr. Dang. It's a good source of energy and it's easy on the digestive system. Do you have a favorite pasta dish you're looking forward to having during this time?\n\nPatient: Alex Spaghetti.",

        "our_model": "Ally's Spaghetti sounds delicious, Mr. Dang. It's a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you usually make it at home or do you have a favorite place where you get it from?"
