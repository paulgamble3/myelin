    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Dang, could you please repeat your favorite low fiber comfort food?\n\nPatient: I like pasta.\n\nNurse: Pasta is a great choice, Mr. Dang. It's a good source of energy and it's easy on the digestive system. Do you have a favorite pasta dish you're looking forward to having during this time?\n\nPatient: Alex Spaghetti.\n\nNurse: Ally's Spaghetti sounds delicious, Mr. Dang. It's a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you usually make it at home or do you have a favorite place where you get it from?\n\nPatient: To make it at home.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Dang. Homemade meals are often the best. Do you have a special recipe for Ally's Spaghetti that you follow, or do you like to experiment with different ingredients each time?\n\nPatient: No. But just put it in a pot and boil the water and make it.",
