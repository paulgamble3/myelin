    "prompt": "Nurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Dang. Homemade meals are often the best. Do you have a special recipe for Ally's Spaghetti that you follow, or do you like to experiment with different ingredients each time?\n\nPatient: No. But just put it in a pot and boil the water and make it.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a straightforward and effective method, Mr. Dang. It's always nice to have a simple and delicious meal that you can prepare quickly. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Dang. It's critical to avoid those supplements and medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.",

        "gpt4": "Great to hear that, Mr. Dang. A positive attitude will certainly help with managing the clear liquid diet and bowel prep. You've told me earlier that you're not worried and are managing this well. That's fantastic. We do recognize here at O'Connor Hospital that many find the bowel prep a bit difficult. Yet, there are also those who have sailed through it just fine. Which group do you feel you might fall into?",
        "our_model": "I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Dang. It's common to feel a bit apprehensive about this part of the preparation. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the process?"
