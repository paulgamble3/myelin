    "prompt": "Nurse: That sounds like a straightforward and effective method, Mr. Dang. It's always nice to have a simple and delicious meal that you can prepare quickly. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Dang. It's critical to avoid those supplements and medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Dang. It's common to feel a bit apprehensive about this part of the preparation. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the process?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Dang. You don't have to do anything just yet, but you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This means no solid foods and drinking either clear or light-colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?",
