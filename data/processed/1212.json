    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Dang. It's common to feel a bit apprehensive about this part of the preparation. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the process?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: No. That's okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. Just to give you an idea, clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Great to hear, Mr. Dang. The other main step to remember is taking the NuLYTELY laxative solution the night before your procedure. You will need to start drinking the first half of the solution around 6 PM. Then, you'll wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on how to make the bowel preparation easier?",
