    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Dang. It's common to feel a bit apprehensive about this part of the preparation. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the process?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: No. That's okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. Just to give you an idea, clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Dang. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. I'm okay.",

        "gpt4": "No problem, Mr. Dang. Just remember, it can be helpful to drink the laxative solution cold and through a straw to make it go down easier. Is there anything you'd like to know about the bowel prep, or do you have other concerns?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Dang. If you change your mind or have any questions later, feel free to ask. Some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. Now, let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?"
