    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay, Mr. Dang. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. I'm okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. If you change your mind or have any questions later, feel free to ask. Some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. Now, let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Dang. You'll need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. This includes water and any other clear liquids. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have 2 more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions about anything we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: No.",
