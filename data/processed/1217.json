Now, let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Dang. You'll need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. This includes water and any other clear liquids.

You mentioned earlier about enjoying pasta. If you've noticed any changes in energy levels or mobility since changing to a low fiber diet, we definitely want to track this and I will definitely note it down for your care team to review.",
