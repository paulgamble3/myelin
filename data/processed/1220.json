        "gpt4": "I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Dang. So just to recap, we've discussed your current medications, diet prep for your procedure, and the clear liquid diet. We also covered the bowel prep, when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure, symptoms of illness, and your ride home after the procedure. Does that sound correct?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Dang. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over your medication, diet changes, and the bowel prep with the NuLYTELY laxative solution. You've confirmed that you're feeling good about the procedure and you've arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?"
