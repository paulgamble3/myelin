    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Dang. It's important to have someone available to take you home after the procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the day of your procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over your medication, diet changes, and the bowel prep with the NuLYTELY laxative solution. You've confirmed that you're feeling good about the procedure and you've arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Dang. I want to remind you that we're here for you every step of the way. I will call you again the day before the procedure to go over step by step all the prep instructions. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, you can reach us at 641-381-6523. [\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]",
