        "gpt4": "It's completely natural to feel scared about an upcoming surgery, Ms. Raynier. Your feelings are valid and I'm here to support you. A lot of people who have had this procedure have felt the same way before, but most of them feel better after having their questions answered. What specifically about the surgery is making you most anxious? Is it the procedure itself, the recovery, or something else?",

But please remember that your surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, is highly experienced and has performed over 1000 total knee replacements. She's known for her excellent work. Is there anything you're looking forward to once you've recovered from your surgery?"
