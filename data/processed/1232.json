Generally, the majority of knee replacements can last for 20 years and even longer, depending on factors like your overall health, lifestyle and how well you follow post-surgery care instructions. Your surgeon will provide more specific details based on your individual circumstances.",

It's important to remember that everyone's experience is unique, but with proper care and rehabilitation, you can expect your new knee to serve you well for a significant period of time. Is there anything else you're concerned about regarding the surgery?"
