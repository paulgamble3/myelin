But\n\nPatient: if I get\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Raynier, you were saying something about the surgery?\n\nPatient: you know, knee replacement surgery. How long do the new joints last?\n\nNurse: Give me a moment while I figure out how I can best help you. That's a very valid question, Ms. Raynier. On average, knee replacements can last between 10 to 15 years. It's important to remember that everyone's experience is unique, but with proper care and rehabilitation, you can expect your new knee to serve you well for a significant period of time. Is there anything else you're concerned about regarding the surgery?\n\nPatient: That's the main thing right now. I I also wanna know if I'm gonna be in a lot pain afterwards.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your concerns, Ms. Raynier. After a total knee replacement, it's normal to experience some pain. However, the pain is usually well managed with medications. Your doctor and the team will work closely with you to ensure your comfort. Over time, as you heal and go through physical therapy, the pain will decrease and you should regain your mobility. Would you like me to go over the details of your upcoming procedure to help alleviate some of your concerns?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you, Ms. Raynier. Your total knee replacement procedure is scheduled for the 15th of next month. You'll be admitted to the hospital on the day of your surgery. Upon arrival, you'll meet with your anesthesiologist to discuss anesthesia options. Typically, spinal or general anesthesia is used. The surgery itself will take around 1 to 2 hours. \n\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon will remove the damaged parts of your knee joint and replace them with an artificial knee. Once the surgery is complete, you'll be moved to a recovery room where the staff will monitor you as you wake up from the anesthesia.\n\nAfter surgery, you may experience some pain, as you've mentioned, but our team will provide you with pain killers as needed. Physical therapy will begin as early as the day after your surgery. It's a key part of your recovery to help you regain strength and movement in your knee.\n\nI hope that gives you a better understanding of what to expect. Do you have any other questions or concerns?",
