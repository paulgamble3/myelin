        "gpt4": "Alright, thank you. Firstly, the surgery should take around 1-2 hours. Following the procedure, you'll likely wake up in a recovery room where your vitals will be monitored closely. \n\nThe procedure itself involves replacing the damaged parts of your knee joint with an artificial joint. This mechanical joint is designed to reduce pain and improve function in your knee.\n\nAs for pain following the surgery, it is normal to experience some discomfort as your body heals. But, we will give you pain medication to help manage this, and physical therapy will be beneficial in the recovery process. \n\nIn addition, the healthcare provider will give you specific instructions on wound care, diet, and exercise to ensure successful recovery and rehabilitation. \n\nRemember Ms. Raynier, the team at the hospital will be there to ensure your comfort and guide you through recovery. This procedure will significantly improve your quality of life. Do you have any other concerns or questions?",
