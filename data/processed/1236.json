    "prompt": "Nurse: Give me a moment while I figure out how I can best help you. That's a very valid question, Ms. Raynier. On average, knee replacements can last between 10 to 15 years. It's important to remember that everyone's experience is unique, but with proper care and rehabilitation, you can expect your new knee to serve you well for a significant period of time. Is there anything else you're concerned about regarding the surgery?\n\nPatient: That's the main thing right now. I I also wanna know if I'm gonna be in a lot pain afterwards.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your concerns, Ms. Raynier. After a total knee replacement, it's normal to experience some pain. However, the pain is usually well managed with medications. Your doctor and the team will work closely with you to ensure your comfort. Over time, as you heal and go through physical therapy, the pain will decrease and you should regain your mobility. Would you like me to go over the details of your upcoming procedure to help alleviate some of your concerns?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Ms. Raynier. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need. Is it okay if we review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, let's first get all the logistics out of the way.

Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
