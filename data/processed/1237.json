    "prompt": "Nurse: I appreciate your concerns, Ms. Raynier. After a total knee replacement, it's normal to experience some pain. However, the pain is usually well managed with medications. Your doctor and the team will work closely with you to ensure your comfort. Over time, as you heal and go through physical therapy, the pain will decrease and you should regain your mobility. Would you like me to go over the details of your upcoming procedure to help alleviate some of your concerns?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Ms. Raynier. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need. Is it okay if we review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you, Ms. Raynier?\n\nPatient: Mhmm. Yeah.",
