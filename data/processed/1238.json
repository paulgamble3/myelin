    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely, Ms. Raynier. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need. Is it okay if we review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you, Ms. Raynier?\n\nPatient: Mhmm. Yeah.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you, Ms. Raynier?\n\nPatient: No.",
