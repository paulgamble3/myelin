    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize for any confusion, Ms. Raynier. You're correct. It's 5 days before the procedure. So, you should have stopped taking Plavix two days ago, correct?\n\nPatient: Three days ago because my procedure is in two days.\n\nNurse: I see, thank you for clarifying, Ms. Raynier. So, you stopped taking Plavix three days ago, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, Ms. Raynier. You're following the instructions correctly. Do you have any questions about Plavix or why it was necessary to stop it before your procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Raynier. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "That's good to hear, Ms. Raynier. You're also prescribed Advil, Gabapentin, and Cymbalta. These medications should not interfere with your procedure but I will advise that you bring them when you come for the procedure to keep the healthcare team informed about all your medications. Also, you've been prescribed Tylenol and Tramadol which needs to be taken after the procedure. Have you already picked them up from the pharmacy?",
        "our_model": "That's good to hear, Ms. Raynier. It's critical to avoid those medications before your surgery unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol and Tramadol for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications yet?"
