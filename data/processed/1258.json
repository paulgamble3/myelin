    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Raynier. The chlorhexidine scrub is available at most pharmacies over the counter. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Ms. Raynier. After taking a shower like normal, you'll turn the water off. Then, you'll apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. Remember to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Ms. Raynier. Finally, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that was a lot. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Raynier. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes. I can.",

You shouldn't eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the surgery. Do you have any questions about this?",
