    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, that's correct. You should stop consuming any food or drink, including water, 4 hours before your procedure. This is to ensure your stomach is empty for the procedure. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: It does not make any sense. So you're saying that I have to wake up in the middle of the night to drink this go lightly saying and have nothing to drink. Nothing. That's, like, very intense process I don't understand why I signed up for this.\n\nNurse: I understand your concerns. The process might seem intense, but it's designed to ensure your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. This helps Doctor Bailey get the most accurate results. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Now, I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I only have 2 more questions left for you. But I wanted to take a pause to first ask if you have any questions and warmly respond.\n\nPatient: Oh, gosh. No. No questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the next question. I want to check if you have any signs of illness. Do you currently have any fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health for your procedure. Now, let's transition to the last question. Have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have, ma'am.",
