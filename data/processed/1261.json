I can.\n\nNurse: That's great, Ms. Raynier. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Raynier. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Okay, Ms. Raynier. I'm glad to hear that you're doing well. Now, I'd like to ask if you have any signs of illness. Do you currently have a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",
