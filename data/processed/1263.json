Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Okay, Ms. Raynier. I'm glad to hear that you're doing well. Now, I'd like to ask if you have any signs of illness. Do you currently have a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Raynier. It's important that you're in good health before your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yes. It is.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Ms. Raynier. It's critical to have a plan in place for when you return home after the procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
