    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Raynier. It's important that you're in good health before your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yes. It is.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Ms. Raynier. It's critical to have a plan in place for when you return home after the procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Raynier. It's critical to have someone to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to arrange, remember you still have time. Do you have any questions about the post-procedure plans?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Raynier. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Wondering is will it be really hard for me to walk after the surgery?",

        "gpt4": "It's completely normal to be concerned about mobility after a total knee replacement, Ms. Raynier. The knee may indeed feel weak and be swollen for initial few days after surgery, which can make it difficult to walk without assistance. Physical therapy will play a crucial role in helping you regain strength and improve your walking over time. Initially, you will use a walker or crutches, and as you progress, you can transition to using a cane. Remember to follow the physical therapy regimen closely for the best result. Does that answer your question?",
        "our_model": "That's a very valid question, Ms. Raynier. After your surgery, you will likely need some assistance with walking initially. This is because your knee will be healing and it's important not to put too much strain on it. Over time, with physical therapy and rehabilitation, you should regain your mobility and be able to walk without assistance. Does that help alleviate some of your concerns?"
