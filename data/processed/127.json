    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand your concerns. The process might seem intense, but it's designed to ensure your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. This helps Doctor Bailey get the most accurate results. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Now, I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I only have 2 more questions left for you. But I wanted to take a pause to first ask if you have any questions and warmly respond.\n\nPatient: Oh, gosh. No. No questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the next question. I want to check if you have any signs of illness. Do you currently have any fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health for your procedure. Now, let's transition to the last question. Have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have, ma'am.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's important to have someone available to take you home after the procedure. You're doing a great job preparing for your colonoscopy. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Nope. No questions, no concerns, nothing.",

        "gpt4": "Alright. I understand. We've covered many topics today including the timing and location of your procedure, diet and medication adjustments, and transportation needs. Does all of that sound right to you?",
        "our_model": "Alright, I appreciate your time and patience today. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over the preparation process, what to expect during the procedure, and any post-procedure care. You've agreed to follow the low fiber diet, the clear liquid diet, and the bowel prep with the NuLYTELY laxative solution. You've also confirmed that you have arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?"
