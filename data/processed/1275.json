I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you for taking the time to speak with me, Mr. O'Leary. How has your day been so far?\n\nPatient: Just like yesterday and the day before, I just have a lot of pain in my knee,\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing a lot of pain, Mr. O'Leary. It's certainly not easy dealing with such discomfort. I'm here to help you prepare for your upcoming procedure which will hopefully alleviate that pain. Is there anything in particular that's been helping you manage the pain today?\n\nPatient: Oh, today?",
