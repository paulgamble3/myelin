Is this a good time to talk?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you for taking the time to speak with me, Mr. O'Leary. How has your day been so far?\n\nPatient: Just like yesterday and the day before, I just have a lot of pain in my knee,\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing a lot of pain, Mr. O'Leary. It's certainly not easy dealing with such discomfort. I'm here to help you prepare for your upcoming procedure which will hopefully alleviate that pain. Is there anything in particular that's been helping you manage the pain today?\n\nPatient: Oh, today?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. O'Leary. What have you been doing today to manage your knee pain?\n\nPatient: I just take well, I just take my my pain killers and anti inflammatory and I can't move around much because of the arthritis pain. Will this arthritis pain in my knee improve after their procedure?",

        "gpt4": "Yes, Mr. O'Leary, once your knee has healed from the surgery, it's expected that the pain from the arthritis in your knee will significantly decrease or even disappear. Total knee replacement surgery replaces the damaged parts of your knee with artificial parts, which can eliminate the source of the arthritis pain. With your new knee, you might be able to move around more comfortably. It sounds like mobility is important for you. What are you looking forward to doing once you've recovered from surgery?",
        "our_model": "Yes, Mr. O'Leary, the total knee replacement procedure is designed to relieve the pain caused by arthritis. It's a very successful procedure with a high success rate. After recovery, most patients experience significant improvement in their knee function and a reduction in pain. It's a big step towards improving your mobility and quality of life. Speaking of which, have you thought about what you'd like to do once your knee is feeling better?"
