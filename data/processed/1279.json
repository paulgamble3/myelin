    "prompt": "Patient: I just take well, I just take my my pain killers and anti inflammatory and I can't move around much because of the arthritis pain. Will this arthritis pain in my knee improve after their procedure?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. O'Leary, the total knee replacement procedure is designed to relieve the pain caused by arthritis. It's a very successful procedure with a high success rate. After recovery, most patients experience significant improvement in their knee function and a reduction in pain. It's a big step towards improving your mobility and quality of life. Speaking of which, have you thought about what you'd like to do once your knee is feeling better?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I would like to just be able to walk without horrible pain.\n\nNurse: That's a wonderful goal, Mr. O'Leary. Walking without pain can significantly improve your daily life. It's a simple yet powerful aspiration. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm looking forward to it, and I'm not looking forward to it. I'm hoping the pain will get better quickly. But it's always a little nerve wracking to have a major surgery and go under general and\n\nPatient: esthesia.\n\nNurse: I can certainly appreciate your mixed feelings, Mr. O'Leary. It's completely normal to feel both hopeful about the potential relief from pain and a bit nervous about the procedure itself. If you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward, I'm here to help. Would you like to go over anything in particular?\n\nPatient: Well, I forgot what my doctor said. About my aspirin and if I stop taking it or not. But I've been taking it because I'm worried about having another stroke.",

        "gpt4": "I see, your concerns are certainly valid, Mr. O'Leary. In terms of aspirin usage, it's typically suggested to discontinue it several days prior to surgery due to its blood-thinning effects. However, given your history of stroke, your individual plan might be different. I advise you to double-check with your surgeon regarding the exact instructions. Would you like me to relay a message to the surgeon's team about this?",
        "our_model": "I see, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to remember that your doctor instructed you to stop taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day 7 days before the procedure. This is a common instruction to prevent excessive bleeding during surgery. However, I would recommend calling your doctor to confirm this if you're still unsure. They can provide the most accurate and up-to-date information based on your health history. Can we move forward with discussing the logistics of your procedure?"
