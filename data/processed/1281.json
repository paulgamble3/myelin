    "prompt": "Patient: Well, I'm looking forward to it, and I'm not looking forward to it. I'm hoping the pain will get better quickly. But it's always a little nerve wracking to have a major surgery and go under general and\n\nPatient: esthesia.\n\nNurse: I can certainly appreciate your mixed feelings, Mr. O'Leary. It's completely normal to feel both hopeful about the potential relief from pain and a bit nervous about the procedure itself. If you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward, I'm here to help. Would you like to go over anything in particular?\n\nPatient: Well, I forgot what my doctor said. About my aspirin and if I stop taking it or not. But I've been taking it because I'm worried about having another stroke.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to remember that your doctor instructed you to stop taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day 7 days before the procedure. This is a common instruction to prevent excessive bleeding during surgery. However, I would recommend calling your doctor to confirm this if you're still unsure. They can provide the most accurate and up-to-date information based on your health history. Can we move forward with discussing the logistics of your procedure?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. O'Leary. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
