    "prompt": "Nurse: I see, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to remember that your doctor instructed you to stop taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day 7 days before the procedure. This is a common instruction to prevent excessive bleeding during surgery. However, I would recommend calling your doctor to confirm this if you're still unsure. They can provide the most accurate and up-to-date information based on your health history. Can we move forward with discussing the logistics of your procedure?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. O'Leary. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Right knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. O'Leary. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
