    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent, Mr. O'Leary. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, let's talk about your medications. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day. As we discussed earlier, you were instructed to stop this medication 7 days before the procedure. That means you should have stopped taking it yesterday, August 6th. Can you confirm if you've stopped taking your Aspirin?\n\nPatient: Well, I took it this morning, but I won't take it anymore.\n\nNurse: Thank you for your honesty, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to follow these instructions for your safety during the procedure. I'm glad to hear that you've decided to stop taking the Aspirin. Do you have any questions about this medication or the instructions to stop it?\n\nPatient: No. I just forgot what the doctor had told me, but you've reminded me. So I'll stop now.",
