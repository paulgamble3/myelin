    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, let's talk about your medications. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day. As we discussed earlier, you were instructed to stop this medication 7 days before the procedure. That means you should have stopped taking it yesterday, August 6th. Can you confirm if you've stopped taking your Aspirin?\n\nPatient: Well, I took it this morning, but I won't take it anymore.\n\nNurse: Thank you for your honesty, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to follow these instructions for your safety during the procedure. I'm glad to hear that you've decided to stop taking the Aspirin. Do you have any questions about this medication or the instructions to stop it?\n\nPatient: No. I just forgot what the doctor had told me, but you've reminded me. So I'll stop now.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could help clarify that for you, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to ensure you're following the correct instructions for your health. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. O'Leary. It's critical to avoid those medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Now, I notice that you've also been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
