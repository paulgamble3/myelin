    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad I could help clarify that for you, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to ensure you're following the correct instructions for your health. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. O'Leary. It's critical to avoid those medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Now, I notice that you've also been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. O'Leary. Having those medications on hand will be helpful for managing any pain you might experience after the procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns?\n\nPatient: Not that I can think of.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. If any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to discuss how to prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased a chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No. Not yet.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. O'Leary. You will need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. It's available at most pharmacies over the counter, and it's crucial to prevent infection. Let me provide detailed instructions on how to use it. Are you ready?",
        "our_model": "That's okay, Mr. O'Leary. Chlorhexidine scrubs are available at most pharmacies over the counter. You'll need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?"
