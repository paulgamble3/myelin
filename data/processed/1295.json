    "prompt": "Nurse: That's okay, Mr. O'Leary. Chlorhexidine scrubs are available at most pharmacies over the counter. You'll need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. O'Leary. After you've turned the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. O'Leary. After you've gently scrubbed for 5 minutes, you'll rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. Just to reiterate, you'll need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Excellent, Mr. O'Leary. It's great that you're clear on those pre-surgical hygiene steps. Let's transition to another important part of your pre-procedure preparation, which is when to stop eating and drinking. It's very important for your safety during the procedure that you don't eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Does that instruction sound clear to you?",
