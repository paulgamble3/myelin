Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. Just to reiterate, you'll need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. O'Leary. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure.

        "gpt4": "You're not alone in wanting to fight obesity, Mr. O'Leary, and it's very positive to see your commitment. As for your diet, it's generally important to focus on a balanced meal plan that includes lean proteins, fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. It'd be beneficial to limit sugary drinks, salty snacks, and foods high in saturated fats. Of course, everyone's dietary needs are unique, so getting a personalized plan from a dietitian or nutritionist would be most beneficial. Would you like me to find resources or services available to you for diet and nutrition?",
