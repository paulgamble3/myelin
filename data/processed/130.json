    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. It's important to have someone available to take you home after the procedure. You're doing a great job preparing for your colonoscopy. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Nope. No questions, no concerns, nothing.\n\nNurse: Alright, I appreciate your time and patience today. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over the preparation process, what to expect during the procedure, and any post-procedure care. You've agreed to follow the low fiber diet, the clear liquid diet, and the bowel prep with the NuLYTELY laxative solution. You've also confirmed that you have arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That all sound right. [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: Great, I'm glad we're on the same page. Remember, I'm here for you every step of the way. I will call you again the day before the procedure to go over step by step all the prep instructions. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, you can call us back at 641-381-6523.\n\nPatient: Alright.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your time today. I know this isn't an easy process, but you're doing a great job preparing for your colonoscopy. I'm looking forward to speaking with you again next time. Take care and remember to enjoy some of your favorite low fiber foods during your prep. Goodbye for now.\n\nPatient: Okay.",
