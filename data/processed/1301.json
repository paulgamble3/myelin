However, I would recommend speaking with a dietitian or a nutritionist for a personalized plan. They can provide the most accurate and effective advice based on your specific needs and health history. Can we proceed with the last few questions I have for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. I would like having a dietitian, and, yes, we can continue.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. O'Leary. We'll make sure to arrange a consultation with a dietitian for you. Now, I'd like to ask if you've noticed any signs of illness recently, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. O'Leary. Going home after the procedure is a good plan. It's critical to have a comfortable and safe environment for your recovery. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
