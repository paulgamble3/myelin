    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. O'Leary. Going home after the procedure is a good plan. It's critical to have a comfortable and safe environment for your recovery. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. O'Leary. Having someone to assist you after the procedure is very important. It's great to hear that you've already arranged that. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your discharge plan?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. If any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. You've answered all my questions.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. O'Leary. Before we end the call, let's quickly summarize what you still need to do before your procedure. You'll need to stop taking your Aspirin, use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure, and remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
