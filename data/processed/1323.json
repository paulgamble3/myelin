It's essential to remember that everyone's recovery process is unique, but the success rate for total knee replacements is very high. Before we move on, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Will there be a lot of pain there to the procedure?\n\nNurse: It's completely normal to have some concerns about pain. The goal of your knee replacement is to relieve the pain you're currently experiencing due to your osteoarthritis.

Over time, as you recover, the pain will decrease and you should experience significant relief compared to your current condition. Does that help address your concern?\n\nPatient: I mean, I guess so.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I'd like to review a few topics with you to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: So I have osteoarthritis. I",
