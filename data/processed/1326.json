        "gpt4": "Yes, you're absolutely right. Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis are different. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition that typically affects the joints as we age, or due to injury. It mainly involves wear-and-tear damage.\n\nRheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disorder where your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues, including the joints. This can lead to inflammation and joint damage.\n\nYour knee replacement surgery will address the pain and mobility issues caused by your osteoarthritis. Do you have any other questions on this or any other topic?",
        "our_model": "Yes, that's correct. Osteoarthritis, which you have, is a degenerative joint disease that affects the cartilage in your joints. It's often related to age or injury. Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the joints. It's not related to age or injury, but rather a problem with the immune system. Is there anything else you'd like to know about these conditions?"
