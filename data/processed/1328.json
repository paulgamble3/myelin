    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, I'm here. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: Is I t o r\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: dry is different from rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nNurse: Yes, that's correct. Osteoarthritis, which you have, is a degenerative joint disease that affects the cartilage in your joints. It's often related to age or injury. Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the joints. It's not related to age or injury, but rather a problem with the immune system. Is there anything else you'd like to know about these conditions?\n\nPatient: No. Thanks.\n\nNurse: Alright, You're welcome. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
