    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: dry is different from rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nNurse: Yes, that's correct. Osteoarthritis, which you have, is a degenerative joint disease that affects the cartilage in your joints. It's often related to age or injury. Rheumatoid arthritis, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the joints. It's not related to age or injury, but rather a problem with the immune system. Is there anything else you'd like to know about these conditions?\n\nPatient: No. Thanks.\n\nNurse: Alright, You're welcome. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Okay.",
