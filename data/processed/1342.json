You should be taking 1000 mg three times a day as needed for pain, not just up to three times a day. Does that clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Alright.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming. Now, I notice that you've also been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: that you've also been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: What?\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion. I was referring to your current medication, Tylenol 500 mg. You can take this as needed for pain, up to three times a day. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. We talked about that.",
