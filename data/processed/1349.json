    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, I'm here. I was asking if you've already purchased a chlorhexidine scrub. This is a special scrub that helps prepare your skin for surgery and reduce the risk of infection. It's available at most pharmacies over the counter. Have you picked one up yet?\n\nPatient: What about it?\n\nNurse: for surgery and reduces the risk of infection. It's available at most pharmacies over the counter. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: I picked it up. Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. You'll need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect. After you've turned the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. Remember to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: What?",
