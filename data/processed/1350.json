Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. You'll need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect. After you've turned the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. Remember to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: What?\n\nNurse: I'm asking if you can follow the instructions for using the chlorhexidine scrub. You'll need to apply it to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub your body from the neck down, avoiding your face, hair, and crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: I did",
