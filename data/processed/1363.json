    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling scared, Mr. Grewe. It's completely normal to feel this way before a major procedure. Can you tell me more about what's making you feel scared?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I'm scared of this procedure.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Grewe. It's completely normal to feel scared about a procedure like this. It's a big step, but it's also a step towards reducing the pain you've been experiencing and improving your mobility. Is there anything specific about the procedure that's worrying you?\n\nPatient: Positive last night, and so now I'm scared that they can't have the procedure.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you had a positive COVID test, Mr. Grewe. I can see why that would add to your worries. However, the timing of your test means that you should be out of the isolation period by the time of your procedure. It's essential to discuss this with your doctor, though. Would you like me to arrange a call with your doctor to discuss this further?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Great, I'll arrange for your doctor to give you a call to discuss your situation and the upcoming procedure. In the meantime, I'd like to acknowledge that you must be looking forward to getting a new knee. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once\n\nPatient: So it's gonna be okay?",

        "gpt4": "From what I know, Mr. Grewe, many patients who had a scheduled surgery postponed due to COVID were able to successfully have their surgery at a later date. But it's critical to have a conversation with your doctor about this. It's their role to examine your unique situation and make the best medical decision. Even with this delay, it's still a great opportunity for you to focus on getting healthier. Once your knee is better, is there something you're looking forward to doing that you haven't been able to because of your knee pain?",
        "our_model": "While it's important to discuss your recent COVID-19 diagnosis with your doctor, it's likely that your procedure will still be able to go ahead as planned. However, the final decision will be made by your doctor based on your current health status. Would you like me to arrange a call with your doctor to discuss this further?"
