    "prompt": "Nurse: I see, Mr. Grewe. It's completely normal to feel scared about a procedure like this. It's a big step, but it's also a step towards reducing the pain you've been experiencing and improving your mobility. Is there anything specific about the procedure that's worrying you?\n\nPatient: Positive last night, and so now I'm scared that they can't have the procedure.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you had a positive COVID test, Mr. Grewe. I can see why that would add to your worries. However, the timing of your test means that you should be out of the isolation period by the time of your procedure. It's essential to discuss this with your doctor, though. Would you like me to arrange a call with your doctor to discuss this further?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Great, I'll arrange for your doctor to give you a call to discuss your situation and the upcoming procedure. In the meantime, I'd like to acknowledge that you must be looking forward to getting a new knee. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once\n\nPatient: So it's gonna be okay?\n\nNurse: While it's important to discuss your recent COVID-19 diagnosis with your doctor, it's likely that your procedure will still be able to go ahead as planned. However, the final decision will be made by your doctor based on your current health status. Would you like me to arrange a call with your doctor to discuss this further?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",

        "our_model": "I'll arrange for your doctor to call you to discuss your situation further. In the meantime, Mr. Grewe, it's natural to feel a bit nervous before a procedure like this. But remember, you're getting a new knee that will help you move around better and with less pain. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once you've recovered from your knee replacement?"
