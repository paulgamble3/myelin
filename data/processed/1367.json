    "prompt": "Patient: So it's gonna be okay?\n\nNurse: While it's important to discuss your recent COVID-19 diagnosis with your doctor, it's likely that your procedure will still be able to go ahead as planned. However, the final decision will be made by your doctor based on your current health status. Would you like me to arrange a call with your doctor to discuss this further?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: I'll arrange for your doctor to call you to discuss your situation further. In the meantime, Mr. Grewe, it's natural to feel a bit nervous before a procedure like this. But remember, you're getting a new knee that will help you move around better and with less pain. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once you've recovered from your knee replacement?\n\nPatient: Wanna go to my grandkids' birthday. So it's in a week after the surgery can you think I'll be able to do that?\n\nNurse: I appreciate you letting me know. Give me a moment to check how I can best help you. I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Mr. Grewe. It's critical to remember that recovery times can vary from person to person, and it's crucial not to rush the healing process. However, with proper care and rest, it's possible that you could be feeling well enough to attend your grandkids' birthday. Your doctor will be able to provide a more accurate timeline based on your progress. Now, how are you feeling about the procedure itself?\n\nPatient: I'm nervous about that too.",
