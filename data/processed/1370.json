    "prompt": "Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful plan, Mr. Grewe. It's critical to remember that recovery times can vary from person to person, and it's crucial not to rush the healing process. However, with proper care and rest, it's possible that you could be feeling well enough to attend your grandkids' birthday. Your doctor will be able to provide a more accurate timeline based on your progress. Now, how are you feeling about the procedure itself?\n\nPatient: I'm nervous about that too.\n\nNurse: I can see why you might be feeling nervous, Mr. Grewe. It's a big step. But remember, you're in the hands of a very experienced team. Your surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, has performed over 1000 total knee replacements and is highly regarded in her field. Do you have any specific questions or concerns about the procedure that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Well, my osteoarthritis pain actually improved.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that your osteoarthritis pain has improved, Mr. Grewe. It's essential to remember that while the pain may have improved, the underlying condition is still there. The total knee replacement is intended to provide you with long-term relief and improved mobility. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Grewe. If you have any questions at any point during our conversation, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help you. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great! Just to confirm, you'll be coming in for your pre-operative appointment in two days, correct? This is a critical time to clarify any remaining questions and finalize the details of your surgery with your surgeon. Have you arranged transportation to and from the hospital for that day and the day of your surgery as well?",
        "our_model": "Okay, thank you, Mr. Grewe. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?"
