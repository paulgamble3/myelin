I'm here to help you. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay, thank you, Mr. Grewe. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way.

Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's okay with me.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Grewe. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor.
