    "prompt": "Patient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay, thank you, Mr. Grewe. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's okay with me.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Grewe. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sure.\n\nNurse: I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Grewe. I'm glad that works for you. I want to remind you that due to current health guidelines, we have a strict visitor policy. You're allowed one person to accompany you to the hospital and stay with you during your recovery. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you?\n\nPatient: I didn't realize that, but that shouldn't be a problem.",
