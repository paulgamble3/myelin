    "prompt": "Patient: Yes. That's okay with me.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Grewe. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sure.\n\nNurse: I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Grewe. I'm glad that works for you. I want to remind you that due to current health guidelines, we have a strict visitor policy. You're allowed one person to accompany you to the hospital and stay with you during your recovery. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you?\n\nPatient: I didn't realize that, but that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that the visitor policy shouldn't be a problem for you, Mr. Grewe. It's essential to ensure everyone's safety during these times. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect, let's discuss your medications then. I see on your chart that you are taking Lantus 5 units injection once a day. For the day of the procedure, you'll need to adjust your dose to 2 units of Lantus. That means you will need to make this change in three days from today. Have you stopped taking your medication yet?",
        "our_model": "Great, Mr. Grewe. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Lantus, 5 units once a day. For the day of the procedure, you'll need to adjust this to 2 units of Lantus. Have you already made this adjustment, or is this something you need to do in the coming days?"
