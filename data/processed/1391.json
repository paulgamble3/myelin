    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Grewe. After taking a normal shower, you'll turn off the water. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Grewe. After turning off the water, you'll want to apply the chlorhexidine scrub to a wet, clean washcloth. You'll then gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's essential to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Grewe. After gently scrubbing for about 5 minutes, you'll rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Grewe, could you please repeat what you just said?\n\nPatient: I just called. I'm sorry.",

        "our_model": "No problem at all, Mr. Grewe. I appreciate your patience. To summarize, you'll need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. You'll apply it to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down, avoiding your face, hair, and crotch area. After 5 minutes, you'll rinse it off and pat dry with a clean towel. Can you remember to do that?"
