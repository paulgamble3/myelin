    "prompt": "Patient: But in the meantime, what diet should I follow to lose weight?\n\nNurse: I appreciate your interest in improving your health, Mr. Grewe. A balanced diet is key to weight loss. Try to include a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains in your meals. Limit your intake of processed foods, sugary drinks, and high-fat foods. It's also important to stay active as much as you can. However, it's best to discuss this with your doctor or a dietitian for personalized advice. Would you like me to arrange a call with a dietitian to discuss this further?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nNurse: I'll arrange for a dietitian to call you to discuss a diet plan that's best for you, Mr. Grewe. In the meantime, remember to focus on a balanced diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Grewe. Before we end the call, let's summarize what you still need to do before your procedure. You need to adjust your Lantus dosage to 2 units on the day of the procedure, use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure, and remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
