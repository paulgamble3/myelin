It's completely normal to have some feelings about it. Is there anything specific that's on your mind or any questions you'd like to discuss before we begin?\n\nPatient: I can't think of any now.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Valenzuela. Please remember that you can ask me any questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm nervous, but I'm ready.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Valenzuela, could you please confirm what you just said?\n\nPatient: I said I'm nervous, but I'm ready.\n\nNurse: Give me a moment while I figure out how I can best help you.",
