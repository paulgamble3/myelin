    "prompt": "Nurse: My apologies for the confusion, Mr. Valenzuela. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Valenzuela. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Perfect. Well,\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications, but I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect, Mr. Valenzuela. I want to discuss your medications in relation to your upcoming procedure. I see on your patient's chart that you aren't on any prescribed medication. Is that correct?",
        "our_model": "Wonderful, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?"
