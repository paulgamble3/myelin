    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay, Mr. Valenzuela. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Perfect. Well,\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications, but I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you for confirming, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to know that some over-the-counter medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy, unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. With that out of the way, do you have any questions or concerns about medications for your upcoming procedure?",
