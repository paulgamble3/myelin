    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications, but I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Okay, Mr. Valenzuela. Thank for letting me know. I'd like to smoothly transition into discussing the diet prep for your colonoscopy. Beginning from today, you'll want to start eating a low fiber diet. This means that it would be best to avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruits, and raw fruits or vegetables. Instead, you can consume foods like white bread, white rice, and well-cooked vegetables. Do you have any questions about this dietary change?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to eat a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?"
