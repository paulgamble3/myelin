    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications, but I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to eat a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",
