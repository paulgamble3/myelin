    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to eat a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to follow this diet to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: I enjoyed eating brownies,",

        "gpt4": "Brownies sound delicious, Mr. Valenzuela! This is one of those rare times when doctors actually want their patients to indulge a bit in comfort foods like brownies. You can have them as long as you ensure they are nut-free - as nuts are high in fiber. Do you usually make your brownies at home or do you buy them from a store?",
        "our_model": "Brownies sound like a delicious choice, Mr. Valenzuela. Just remember to have them without any nuts or seeds. Do you usually make them at home or do you buy them from a bakery?"
