    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to eat a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to follow this diet to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: I enjoyed eating brownies,\n\nNurse: Brownies sound like a delicious choice, Mr. Valenzuela. Just remember to have them without any nuts or seeds. Do you usually make them at home or do you buy them from a bakery?\n\nPatient: Oh, I didn't buy them.\n\nNurse: That's interesting, Mr. Valenzuela. Do you have a favorite brownie recipe that you follow when you bake them at home?\n\nPatient: No. I said I buy them. I don't take them.",

It's great to know that you love brownies, and it's good that you can continue enjoying them during your colonoscopy preparation. Although it's a bit unique, doctors often recommend indulging in such comforting foods since they are typically low fiber. Is there a specific store or bakery you usually get your brownies from?",
