I hope your day is going well so far. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: I'm doing okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. It's completely normal to have some feelings about a procedure like this. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or any questions you have before we begin?\n\nPatient: Nope. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Doing okay.",
