    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Valenzuela. I hope your day is going well so far. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: I'm doing okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. It's completely normal to have some feelings about a procedure like this. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or any questions you have before we begin?\n\nPatient: Nope. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Doing okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy. Is that okay?\n\nPatient: Yep.",

I will call you again the day before your procedure to check in and make sure you're all set. \n\nSo let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Dr. Meredith Bailey, which means you'll need to arrive about an hour earlier, by 8:00 AM. Does that work for you?",
