    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. It's completely normal to have some feelings about a procedure like this. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or any questions you have before we begin?\n\nPatient: Nope. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Doing okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy. Is that okay?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your procedure. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
