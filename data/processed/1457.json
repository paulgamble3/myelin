    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics are clear. Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your medication in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications we'll need you to stop, like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications or anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Thanks for confirming. Now, let's talk about diet preparation for your colonoscopy. I'm sure you know how essential it is to follow the guidelines for the best results. \n\nStarting from today, you'll want to stick to a low fiber diet. This includes foods like white bread, pasta, rice, well-cooked vegetables without skin, lean meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. \n\nPlease avoid foods like whole grains, raw fruits and vegetables, seeds, beans, lentils, and tough meat with a lot of fat. \n\nDoes this sound clear to you, Mr. Valenzuela? Do you have any questions about the low fiber diet?",
