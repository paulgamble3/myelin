    "prompt": "Patient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's essential to stop these supplements and medications to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Not super excited, but\n\nPatient: We do what we gotta do. Right?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not the most enjoyable part, but it's crucial for the procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the prep?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.",

        "gpt4": "That's great to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. Just a reminder, you don't have to do anything just yet. You'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids and avoid any solid foods. It involves drinking either clear or light-colored beverages and avoiding any red or purple dye. Would you like me to give examples of what clear liquids are?",
