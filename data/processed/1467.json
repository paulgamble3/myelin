    "prompt": "Patient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Not super excited, but\n\nPatient: We do what we gotta do. Right?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not the most enjoyable part, but it's crucial for the procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the prep?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Valenzuela. Clear liquids can include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red coloring. Do you have any questions about this list, or is there a specific type of clear liquid you would like to know if it's okay to have during your prep?",
