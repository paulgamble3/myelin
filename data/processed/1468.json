    "prompt": "Patient: Not super excited, but\n\nPatient: We do what we gotta do. Right?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not the most enjoyable part, but it's crucial for the procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the prep?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's critical to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",

        "gpt4": "Excellent, Mr. Valenzuela. Remember, sticking to clear liquids will help ensure a successful procedure. Now, let's talk about the other main step in your prep: drinking the PLENVU laxative solution. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6 PM the day before your procedure. And then, you'll need to wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. How do you feel about this part of the prep? Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?",
