    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not the most enjoyable part, but it's crucial for the procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the prep?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's critical to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Okay.",

        "gpt4": "That's great to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. Some patients find that chilling the PLENVU solution in the fridge before you drink it can make it easier to take. You might also find using a straw to sip it helpful. Drinking it slowly rather than in big gulps might make it a bit easier too. Does that help? Do you have any other questions or concerns?",
        "our_model": "Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Here are a couple of tips that might make the bowel prep easier for you. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it more palatable. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?"
