    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's critical to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Here are a couple of tips that might make the bowel prep easier for you. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it more palatable. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: Yeah. And it sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. These tips can make the process a bit more comfortable. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.",
