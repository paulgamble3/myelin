    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Here are a couple of tips that might make the bowel prep easier for you. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it more palatable. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: Yeah. And it sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. These tips can make the process a bit more comfortable. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. The last part of your prep is to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this or anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so?",
