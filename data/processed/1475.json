I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the instructions. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns at any point, don't hesitate to reach out. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela.
