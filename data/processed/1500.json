    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Valenzuela. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I wanted to ask\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Valenzuela. What would you like to ask about the logistics of your procedure?\n\nPatient: Why does cancer risk increase so much with age?",

        "gpt4": "That's a great question, Mr. Valenzuela. The risk of developing most types of cancer increases with age because the changes in our cells that lead to cancer happen more frequently over time. This is particularly true with colon cancer, where the risk for developing this disease increases significantly after age 50. Additionally, age can go hand in hand with other risk factors like a history of polyps or colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, diet, and certain hereditary syndromes. Do you have any other questions about this?",
        "our_model": "That's a very insightful question, Mr. Valenzuela. As we age, our cells go through many cycles of growth, damage, and repair. Over time, these cycles can lead to mutations that may cause cancer. Additionally, our immune system, which helps protect us from cancer, can weaken with age. This is why it's important to have regular screenings like colonoscopies, especially as we get older. Does that help clarify things for you?"
