    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, Mr. Valenzuela. What would you like to ask about the logistics of your procedure?\n\nPatient: Why does cancer risk increase so much with age?\n\nNurse: That's a very insightful question, Mr. Valenzuela. As we age, our cells go through many cycles of growth, damage, and repair. Over time, these cycles can lead to mutations that may cause cancer. Additionally, our immune system, which helps protect us from cancer, can weaken with age. This is why it's important to have regular screenings like colonoscopies, especially as we get older. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad I could provide some clarity. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you for confirming that, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to avoid those medications before a colonoscopy unless your doctor has given you specific advice to continue taking them. Do you have any questions or concerns about this or any other medications?",
        "our_model": "That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications in relation to your upcoming procedure?"
