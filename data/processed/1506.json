    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications in relation to your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions later, feel free to ask. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to eat a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Pasta.",

        "gpt4": "Pasta is a wonderful choice, Mr. Valenzuela. It's comforting and fits within the parameters of your dietary needs for the colonoscopy prep. Are there specific pasta dishes you enjoy? And do you have a favourite pasta shape?",
        "our_model": "Pasta is a great choice, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not only low in fiber but also a comfort food for many. You can enjoy it with a simple sauce, just remember to avoid high fiber ingredients. Do you usually make your own pasta or do you have a favorite type of pasta that you buy from the store?"
