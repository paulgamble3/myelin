    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications in relation to your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions later, feel free to ask. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to eat a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Pasta.\n\nNurse: Pasta is a great choice, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not only low in fiber but also a comfort food for many. You can enjoy it with a simple sauce, just remember to avoid high fiber ingredients. Do you usually make your own pasta or do you have a favorite type of pasta that you buy from the store?\n\nPatient: I just buy it from the store. It you know, I haven't put that much sought into it since it's only one day.",

        "gpt4": "Store-bought pasta can definitely be a time-saver, Mr. Valenzuela. And it's quite understandable not to overthink it since it's just for a day. Remember, it's a rare occasion when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Just be careful to avoid any sauces with seeds, nuts, and chunks of vegetables as they might interfere with the colonoscopy prep. Is there anything else you'd like to ask about the dietary guidelines?",
        "our_model": "I see, Mr. Valenzuela. It's good that you're keeping it simple. This is indeed a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?"
