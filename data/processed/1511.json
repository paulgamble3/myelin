    "prompt": "Patient: I just buy it from the store. It you know, I haven't put that much sought into it since it's only one day.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Valenzuela. It's good that you're keeping it simple. This is indeed a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: Are you there, Rachel?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Valenzuela, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please confirm if you're currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: Give me a moment to check how I can best support you.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela.

Now, about the clear liquid diet. You don't need to start just yet, but 24 hours prior to your procedure, you'll need to start your bowel prep by consuming only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or lightly colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Would it be helpful if I provide some examples of clear liquid diet food options?",
