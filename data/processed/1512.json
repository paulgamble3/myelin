Could you please confirm if you're currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: Give me a moment to check how I can best support you.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions later, feel free to ask. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Again ready to get this over with.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Valenzuela. It's a common sentiment that the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: I don't have any questions.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Just to make sure we're on the same page, let's go over the specifics of the clear liquid diet. You'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This means no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages - no red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and if you have any questions about the diet, feel free to ask. Examples include water, green tea, clear broth, light-colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Does that make sense?",
