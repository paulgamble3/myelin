    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Valenzuela, your message got cut off. Could you please confirm if you understand the clear liquid diet instructions?\n\nPatient: Yes. I do.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you understand the clear liquid diet instructions. If you have any questions later, feel free to ask. Now, let's move on to the other main step to remember, which is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions later, feel free to ask. Now, let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No questions.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on this. If you have any questions later, feel free to ask. Now, I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have 2 more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions about anything we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: No.",
