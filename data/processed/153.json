    "prompt": "Patient: No.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Valenzuela. I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Sure. Let's go ahead.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Valenzuela. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you. Give me a moment to check how I can best support you.",
