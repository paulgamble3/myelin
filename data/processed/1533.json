    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. If you have any questions at any point during our conversation, please feel free to ask. I'm here to ensure you have all the information you need. Is it okay if we review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Moran. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Moran. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Moran. Is there anything else about the logistics of the procedure that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",
