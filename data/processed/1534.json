    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Moran. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Moran. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Moran. Is there anything else about the logistics of the procedure that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. Let's move on to discuss your medications. Before we do, I want to make sure you're ready to proceed. Can we move forward?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
