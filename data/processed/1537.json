Can we move forward?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Moran. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Metformin, Fluticasone, and Albuterol. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Moran. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Moran. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol, Oxycodone, Gabapentin, and Tramadol for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I picked them up today.",
