    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Moran. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol, Oxycodone, Gabapentin, and Tramadol for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I picked them up today.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Moran. It's critical to have these medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other aspect of your medication regimen?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. Let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Moran. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. After taking a normal shower and turning the water off, does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. Moran. Next, apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth. Then gently scrub yourself from the neck down, but avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Does that sound okay?",
