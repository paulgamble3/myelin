    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. Let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Moran. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. After taking a normal shower and turning the water off, does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Moran. After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Moran. Finally, you'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect, Mr. Moran. Please remember to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Let's move on to another important part of your preparation: NPO, or nil per os, which means not eating or drinking anything after midnight before your procedure. I can't stress enough how important this is for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?",
