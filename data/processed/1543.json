    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great, Mr. Moran. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. After taking a normal shower and turning the water off, does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Moran. After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Moran. Finally, you'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. Just to reiterate, you'll need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Fantastic, Mr. Moran. I'm glad you're confident about this. Let's move on to discuss when you need to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You won't be able to eat or drink anything after midnight before your surgery. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?",
