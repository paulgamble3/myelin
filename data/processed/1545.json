    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Moran. Finally, you'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. Just to reiterate, you'll need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Moran. The last thing we need to discuss is when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yes. Can I get an infection after the surgery?",

        "gpt4": "Great question, Mr. Moran. While no procedure is without risks, know that your doctor and the medical team will take every precaution possible to prevent infection both during and after your surgery. This includes maintaining a sterile environment during the operation, prescribing antibiotics, and providing instructions for wound care processes you will follow at home. These efforts help reduce the risk of infection, which is usually quite low. Does that answer your question?",
        "our_model": "That's a very important question, Mr. Moran. While it's possible to get an infection after any surgery, the risk is relatively low with total knee replacements. The chlorhexidine scrub we discussed earlier is one of the ways we reduce this risk. Also, the surgical team takes many precautions during the procedure to minimize the chance of infection. Do you have any other questions about this?"
