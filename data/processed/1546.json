    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. Just to reiterate, you'll need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Moran. The last thing we need to discuss is when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yes. Can I get an infection after the surgery?\n\nNurse: That's a very important question, Mr. Moran. While it's possible to get an infection after any surgery, the risk is relatively low with total knee replacements. The chlorhexidine scrub we discussed earlier is one of the ways we reduce this risk. Also, the surgical team takes many precautions during the procedure to minimize the chance of infection. Do you have any other questions about this?\n\nPatient: How else can I prevent in an infection?",

        "gpt4": "There are several ways you can help prevent an infection after your surgery, Mr. Moran. One way is to take good care of the surgical wound by keeping it clean and dry as advised by your medical team. If there are dressings, change them as instructed. Also, let your doctor know immediately if you notice any signs of infection such as increased redness, swelling, or drainage. Do you have any other questions about preventing an infection?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question, Mr. Moran. In addition to using the chlorhexidine scrub, there are several other things you can do to help prevent infection. These include keeping the surgical area clean and dry, avoiding activities that could cause injury to the surgical area, and promptly reporting any signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or drainage from the surgical site. Also, taking your prescribed antibiotics as directed can help prevent infection. Do you have any other questions about this?"
