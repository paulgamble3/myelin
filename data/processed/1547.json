    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great, Mr. Moran. The last thing we need to discuss is when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yes. Can I get an infection after the surgery?\n\nNurse: That's a very important question, Mr. Moran. While it's possible to get an infection after any surgery, the risk is relatively low with total knee replacements. The chlorhexidine scrub we discussed earlier is one of the ways we reduce this risk. Also, the surgical team takes many precautions during the procedure to minimize the chance of infection. Do you have any other questions about this?\n\nPatient: How else can I prevent in an infection?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Moran. In addition to using the chlorhexidine scrub, there are several other things you can do to help prevent infection. These include keeping the surgical area clean and dry, avoiding activities that could cause injury to the surgical area, and promptly reporting any signs of infection, such as increased redness, swelling, or drainage from the surgical site. Also, taking your prescribed antibiotics as directed can help prevent infection. Do you have any other questions about this?\n\nPatient: No. But I was wondering if my arthritis pain will actually be reduced after the surgery.",

        "gpt4": "That's definitely an understandable concern, Mr. Moran. A total knee replacement is usually very effective at relieving pain caused by arthritis. Most people experience a significant reduction in pain and improvement in their ability to perform common activities of daily living. But do remember that everyone recovers at their own pace, so give yourself time to heal and follow your doctor's orders for rehabilitation. Is there anything else that you would like to know?",
        "our_model": "That's a very valid concern, Mr. Moran. Total knee replacement surgery is one of the most effective treatments for severe knee arthritis. After recovery, most patients experience significant pain relief and improved mobility. However, it's important to remember that everyone's recovery is different and it may take some time to see the full benefits. Do you have any other questions about this?"
