    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a very valid concern, Mr. Moran. Total knee replacement surgery is one of the most effective treatments for severe knee arthritis. After recovery, most patients experience significant pain relief and improved mobility. However, it's important to remember that everyone's recovery is different and it may take some time to see the full benefits. Do you have any other questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. I'm glad we could discuss your concerns. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness recently, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Moran. It's essential to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Moran. It's essential to have a safe and comfortable place to recover after your procedure. Now, I'd like to ask if you've arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: I have.",
