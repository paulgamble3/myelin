    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. I'm glad we could discuss your concerns. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness recently, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Moran. It's essential to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Moran. It's essential to have a safe and comfortable place to recover after your procedure. Now, I'd like to ask if you've arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: I have.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Moran. It's critical to have someone to assist you after the procedure. If there's anything else you need to arrange, you still have time to do so. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your discharge plan?\n\nPatient: No. But I have a random question. Help manage it.",
