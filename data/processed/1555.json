    "prompt": "Nurse: That's excellent, Mr. Moran. It's critical to have someone to assist you after the procedure. If there's anything else you need to arrange, you still have time to do so. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your discharge plan?\n\nPatient: No. But I have a random question. Help manage it.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Moran. I'm here to help with any questions you have. What's your random question?\n\nPatient: I wanna get my diabetes under control And what dietary changes can I make for that?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Moran. Managing your diet is a key part of controlling your diabetes. It's essential to focus on a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Limiting your intake of sugary drinks and high-fat foods can also help. However, it's always best to consult with a dietitian or your healthcare provider for personalized advice. Do you have any other questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Moran. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. Moran. Here's a recap of what you need to do before your procedure: use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure, stop eating and drinking after midnight before your procedure, and ensure that you have someone to drive you home and stay with you afterwards. Can I count on you to remember all that?",
