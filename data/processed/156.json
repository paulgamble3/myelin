        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Valenzuela. I see in your file that you're currently taking a blood thinner called warfarin. For patients who are on medications like yours, we do recommend some changes in the days leading up to the procedure. You'll need to stop taking warfarin 5 days before your procedure. That means you should take your last dose on August 7th. Can you do that?",
        "our_model": "Great, thank you, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your medication in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?"
