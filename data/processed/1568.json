So\n\nNurse: I see, I'm sorry, Mr. Reynolds, I didn't quite catch the last part of what you said. Could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: It's not fun.\n\nNurse: I can see why you might find the preparation and the procedure itself a bit challenging, Mr. Reynolds. It's definitely not the most comfortable of experiences. However, it's great that you're taking this step for your health. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Reynolds. Please remember that you can ask me any questions at any time during our conversation. I see from your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained abdominal pain. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm fine. I haven't been having any abdominal pain.",
