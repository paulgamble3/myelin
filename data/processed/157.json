Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Let's move on.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Valenzuela.

        "gpt4": "Okay, Mr. Valenzuela, thank you for confirming that. It's important to note that blood thinners typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless advised differently by your doctor, so it's good that you're not taking any. Do you have any questions about medications you should or shouldn't take before your colonoscopy?",
        "our_model": "That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's essential to avoid those medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Do you have any questions about your medications or anything else related to them?"
