    "prompt": "Nurse: I can see why you might find the preparation and the procedure itself a bit challenging, Mr. Reynolds. It's definitely not the most comfortable of experiences. However, it's great that you're taking this step for your health. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Reynolds. Please remember that you can ask me any questions at any time during our conversation. I see from your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained abdominal pain. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm fine. I haven't been having any abdominal pain.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Reynolds. Could you please confirm whether you're currently experiencing abdominal pain or not?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you. I appreciate your patience, Mr. Reynolds. I hope this procedure provides you and your doctor with the answers you're looking for. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on preparing for your colonoscopy. Is that okay?\n\nPatient: Sure. Go ahead.",
