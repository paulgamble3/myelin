    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Reynolds. Please remember that you can ask me any questions at any time during our conversation. I see from your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained abdominal pain. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm fine. I haven't been having any abdominal pain.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Reynolds. Could you please confirm whether you're currently experiencing abdominal pain or not?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you. I appreciate your patience, Mr. Reynolds. I hope this procedure provides you and your doctor with the answers you're looking for. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on preparing for your colonoscopy. Is that okay?\n\nPatient: Sure. Go ahead.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Reynolds. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. The Sorry.",
