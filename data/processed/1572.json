    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Reynolds. Could you please confirm whether you're currently experiencing abdominal pain or not?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you. I appreciate your patience, Mr. Reynolds. I hope this procedure provides you and your doctor with the answers you're looking for. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on preparing for your colonoscopy. Is that okay?\n\nPatient: Sure. Go ahead.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Reynolds. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. The Sorry.\n\nNurse: No problem at all, Mr. Reynolds. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine.",
