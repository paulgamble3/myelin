    "prompt": "Patient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you. I appreciate your patience, Mr. Reynolds. I hope this procedure provides you and your doctor with the answers you're looking for. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on preparing for your colonoscopy. Is that okay?\n\nPatient: Sure. Go ahead.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Reynolds. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. The Sorry.\n\nNurse: No problem at all, Mr. Reynolds. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.",

        "gpt4": "Great! Now let's talk about the visitor policy. Due to the current health crisis, the hospital visitor policy allows only one person to accompany you. This visitor will need to comply with all precautions, such as wearing a mask. Also, we advise the person to stay in the car during your procedure. Does this information help? Would you like to discuss anything else?",
        "our_model": "Great, Mr. Reynolds. I'm glad that works for you. I'd like to remind you that due to current health guidelines, we have a strict no-visitor policy in place. This means that you'll need to come alone for your procedure. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you?"
