    "prompt": "Patient: Sure. Go ahead.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Reynolds. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. The Sorry.\n\nNurse: No problem at all, Mr. Reynolds. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Reynolds. I'm glad that works for you. I'd like to remind you that due to current health guidelines, we have a strict no-visitor policy in place. This means that you'll need to come alone for your procedure. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you?\n\nPatient: What do you mean I'll have to come alone?",

        "gpt4": "I'm sorry for any confusion, Mr. Reynolds. Due to current health guidelines, we are limiting the number of people in the hospital in an effort to curb the spread of illness. This means that only patients are allowed inside. While we understand that this may be difficult, as having a friend or family member present can provide comfort, we believe this is the safest decision for all parties involved at this time. I'm here to answer any other questions or concerns you might have about this policy.",
        "our_model": "I apologize if I wasn't clear, Mr. Reynolds. Due to the current health guidelines, we have a policy where patients need to come in for their procedures without any accompanying visitors. This is to ensure everyone's safety and to prevent the spread of any potential illnesses. Does that clarify things for you?"
