    "prompt": "Patient: Yeah. The Sorry.\n\nNurse: No problem at all, Mr. Reynolds. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Reynolds. I'm glad that works for you. I'd like to remind you that due to current health guidelines, we have a strict no-visitor policy in place. This means that you'll need to come alone for your procedure. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you?\n\nPatient: What do you mean I'll have to come alone?\n\nNurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear, Mr. Reynolds. Due to the current health guidelines, we have a policy where patients need to come in for their procedures without any accompanying visitors. This is to ensure everyone's safety and to prevent the spread of any potential illnesses. Does that clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Okay. So I can get dropped off",
    "responses": {
        "gpt4": "Yes, Mr. Reynolds. You may certainly get dropped off for your procedure. However, the individual dropping you off would not be permitted inside the hospital. They would instead need to wait outside or return to pick you up once your procedure is complete. Thank you very much for understanding the situation.",
        "our_model": "Absolutely, Mr. Reynolds. You can certainly get dropped off at the hospital and picked up afterwards. It's just that no one will be able to accompany you inside during your procedure. I hope that's clear. Now, before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to proceed?"
