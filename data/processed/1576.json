    "prompt": "Patient: Yeah. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Reynolds. I'm glad that works for you. I'd like to remind you that due to current health guidelines, we have a strict no-visitor policy in place. This means that you'll need to come alone for your procedure. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you?\n\nPatient: What do you mean I'll have to come alone?\n\nNurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear, Mr. Reynolds. Due to the current health guidelines, we have a policy where patients need to come in for their procedures without any accompanying visitors. This is to ensure everyone's safety and to prevent the spread of any potential illnesses. Does that clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Okay. So I can get dropped off\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Reynolds. You can certainly get dropped off at the hospital and picked up afterwards. It's just that no one will be able to accompany you inside during your procedure. I hope that's clear. Now, before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to proceed?\n\nPatient: but whoever's bringing me can't wait at the hospital.",

        "gpt4": "That's correct, Mr. Reynolds. Because of our current visitor policy to ensure the safety of all our patients and staff due to the pandemic, the person who brings you to the hospital won't be able to wait inside. They can drop you off and pick you up when your procedure is finished. We will keep them updated about your progress during the procedure if you wish. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.",
