    "prompt": "Nurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Reynolds. I'm glad that works for you. I'd like to remind you that due to current health guidelines, we have a strict no-visitor policy in place. This means that you'll need to come alone for your procedure. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you?\n\nPatient: What do you mean I'll have to come alone?\n\nNurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear, Mr. Reynolds. Due to the current health guidelines, we have a policy where patients need to come in for their procedures without any accompanying visitors. This is to ensure everyone's safety and to prevent the spread of any potential illnesses. Does that clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Okay. So I can get dropped off\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Reynolds. You can certainly get dropped off at the hospital and picked up afterwards. It's just that no one will be able to accompany you inside during your procedure. I hope that's clear. Now, before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to proceed?\n\nPatient: but whoever's bringing me can't wait at the hospital.\n\nNurse: Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you.",

        "gpt4": "Correct, Mr. Reynolds. The person who drops you off will not be able to wait at the hospital due to our current visitor restrictions. They should plan to leave the hospital once you've checked in and return to pick you up after your procedure. We will provide them with a timeframe, keeping them informed about when to return for your pick up. Does that make sense?",
        "our_model": "Yes, Mr. Reynolds, that's correct. You can get dropped off at the hospital, and your driver can return to pick you up after your procedure. It's critical to note that due to the sedation used during the colonoscopy, you won't be able to drive yourself home. Does that make sense?"
