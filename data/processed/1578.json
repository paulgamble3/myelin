    "prompt": "Patient: What do you mean I'll have to come alone?\n\nNurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear, Mr. Reynolds. Due to the current health guidelines, we have a policy where patients need to come in for their procedures without any accompanying visitors. This is to ensure everyone's safety and to prevent the spread of any potential illnesses. Does that clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Okay. So I can get dropped off\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Reynolds. You can certainly get dropped off at the hospital and picked up afterwards. It's just that no one will be able to accompany you inside during your procedure. I hope that's clear. Now, before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to proceed?\n\nPatient: but whoever's bringing me can't wait at the hospital.\n\nNurse: Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you.\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Reynolds, that's correct. You can get dropped off at the hospital, and your driver can return to pick you up after your procedure. It's critical to note that due to the sedation used during the colonoscopy, you won't be able to drive yourself home. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Well, yeah. I knew that.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect, Mr. Reynolds. You're right, and apologies for if we overexplained that aspect. Since we've discussed the preparation and schedule, I'd like to proceed with sharing more about what you can expect from the procedure itself. Would this be alright with you?",
        "our_model": "I apologize for any confusion earlier, Mr. Reynolds. I'm glad we're on the same page now. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move forward?"
