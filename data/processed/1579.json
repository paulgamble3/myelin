    "prompt": "Patient: Okay. So I can get dropped off\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Reynolds. You can certainly get dropped off at the hospital and picked up afterwards. It's just that no one will be able to accompany you inside during your procedure. I hope that's clear. Now, before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to proceed?\n\nPatient: but whoever's bringing me can't wait at the hospital.\n\nNurse: Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you.\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Reynolds, that's correct. You can get dropped off at the hospital, and your driver can return to pick you up after your procedure. It's critical to note that due to the sedation used during the colonoscopy, you won't be able to drive yourself home. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Well, yeah. I knew that.\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion earlier, Mr. Reynolds. I'm glad we're on the same page now. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move forward?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Go ahead.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Reynolds. Now, let's discuss your current medication. According to your chart, you're currently taking Plavix 75 mg, a blood thinner. For safety during your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking it 5 days before the procedure. So, you should stop taking the Plavix on August 8th. Are you clear about this change?",
        "our_model": "Wonderful, thank you, Mr. Reynolds. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Plavix 75 mg once a day. Given the instructions for your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking Plavix 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 8th, which is 2 days from today. Does that make sense?"
