    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Reynolds. It's essential to avoid those medications before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any other questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to your diet?\n\nPatient: No. No question. So the letter is\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Reynolds, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: No questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Reynolds.

It's just for a short period before your procedure to make the colonoscopy more effective. Do you have any favorite low fiber comfort foods that you'd like to incorporate into your diet during this time?",
        "our_model": "Yes, Mr. Reynolds, in a way, you could think of it as a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any favorite low fiber foods that you might consider as comfort food?"
