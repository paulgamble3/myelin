    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Let's move on.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your medication in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's essential to avoid those medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Do you have any questions about your medications or anything else related to them?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",
