Do you have any favorite low fiber foods that you might consider as comfort food?\n\nPatient: I'm definitely gonna eat a lot of bread.\n\nNurse: Bread is a great choice, Mr. Reynolds. It's low in fiber and can be quite comforting. You can enjoy it with some butter or jam if you'd like. Do you usually have a particular type of bread you prefer?\n\nPatient: Are you still there?\n\nNurse: Yes, I'm here, Mr. Reynolds. I was asking about your favorite type of bread. [\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Reynolds, it seems like there might be a connection issue. Could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: Like like",
