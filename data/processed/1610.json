    "prompt": "Patient: I do wanna know\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Benton. I'm here to help.\n\nPatient: what does stage\n\nPatient: two e k d me.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you're not experiencing any specific concerns at the moment, Mr. Benton. As for your question, Stage II CKD, or Chronic Kidney Disease, means that your kidneys are not functioning at their full capacity. This can be due to a variety of reasons, including diabetes and high blood pressure, which you have. It's essential to manage these conditions to slow the progression of the kidney disease. Do you have any other questions you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Why do you have to pee in a cup for urine albumin test.\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Benton. The urine albumin test is a way for your doctor to check for albumin in your urine. Albumin is a type of protein that's normally found in the blood. Your kidneys filter out waste from your blood and leave in the things your body needs, like albumin. But when your kidneys are damaged, like in kidney disease, they may let albumin pass into your urine. So, by testing your urine, your doctor can see how well your kidneys are working. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That was lot of good information.",
