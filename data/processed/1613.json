    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great question, Mr. Benton. The urine albumin test is a way for your doctor to check for albumin in your urine. Albumin is a type of protein that's normally found in the blood. Your kidneys filter out waste from your blood and leave in the things your body needs, like albumin. But when your kidneys are damaged, like in kidney disease, they may let albumin pass into your urine. So, by testing your urine, your doctor can see how well your kidneys are working. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That was lot of good information.\n\nNurse: I'm glad you found the information helpful, Mr. Benton. Now, let's move on to your blood sugar and blood pressure. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Benton. Regular monitoring is key in managing your blood sugar levels. Could you please share your last blood sugar reading at home?\n\nPatient: Yeah. It was one twenty five.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Benton. A blood sugar level of 125 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes, which is usually under 120. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great, thank you for being open to it, Mr. Benton.\n\n1. Keep up with your regular medication regimen. It's been prescribed to help control your blood sugar, so it's essential to take them as directed.\n\n2. Balance your meals. Try to have a mix of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats at each meal and be consistent with the amounts of foods you eat. \n\n3. Exercise regularly. This helps lower your blood sugar as your muscles use glucose for energy. If you're already physically active, that's fantastic. If not, a simple walk daily could be a good start. Remember to talk with your doctor before you start or change a fitness routine.\n\n4. Lastly, check your blood sugar regularly. This will allow you to know whether your lifestyle changes or medications are working to control your blood sugar. Does this information make sense? We can go over anything that's unclear.",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Benton. One strategy could be to incorporate more physical activity into your day. Regular exercise can help your body use insulin more effectively and lower your blood sugar levels. Another strategy could be to monitor your carbohydrate intake. Foods high in carbohydrates can raise your blood sugar levels. Lastly, it's important to take your medications as prescribed. Do you have any questions about these suggestions?"
