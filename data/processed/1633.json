        "gpt4": "BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen, which is a waste product that's produced in your body after you eat protein. Your kidneys filter out this waste from your blood. However, if your kidneys aren't functioning correctly, you may have a higher level of BUN in your blood. \n\nLooking at your lab results, your BUN level was 6.17 mmol/L. The normal range can vary depending on the laboratory, but typically, a normal range is around 2.5 to 7.1 mmol/L. So your level appears to be within the normal range. However, it's important to discuss these results with your doctor, as they can interpret them in the context of your overall health. \n\nDo you have any other questions regarding your lab results or anything else?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question, Mr. Benton. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen. It's a waste product that's produced in your body when protein is broken down. Your kidneys filter out BUN, so a high level could indicate that your kidneys aren't working as well as they should be. Your BUN level was 6.17 mmol/L, which is within the normal range. So, your kidneys are doing a good job of filtering out BUN. Does that help clarify things?"
