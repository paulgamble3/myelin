    "prompt": "Nurse: That's excellent, Mr. Benton. Not smoking is beneficial for your overall health and particularly important for managing your chronic conditions. Now, do you have any questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Benton. What's on your mind?\n\nPatient: On my lab works, what is\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Benton.\n\nPatient: bun. And was mine high or was I okay?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Benton. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen. It's a waste product that's produced in your body when protein is broken down. Your kidneys filter out BUN, so a high level could indicate that your kidneys aren't working as well as they should be. Your BUN level was 6.17 mmol/L, which is within the normal range. So, your kidneys are doing a good job of filtering out BUN. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That does. Thank you.",
