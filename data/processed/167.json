    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Mr. Valenzuela, cake can be considered a low fiber food. However, it's important to note that you should avoid whole grain varieties and limit the amount of fruit or other high fiber toppings. Do you have a favorite type of cake that you're thinking of?\n\nPatient: Chocolate.\n\nNurse: Chocolate cake sounds delicious, Mr. Valenzuela. Just remember to enjoy it in moderation and follow the low fiber diet guidelines. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to avoid those supplements and medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Do you have any questions about this or anything else related to your diet or supplements?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling okay.",
