Remember, it's important to limit foods high in saturated and trans fats, and to include more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in your diet. If you ever have any questions or concerns about managing your high cholesterol, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices?\n\nPatient: Oh my goodness. I have never smoked and would never consider smoking.\n\nNurse: That's excellent to hear. Not smoking is one of the best things you can do for your health, especially with your chronic conditions. If you ever have any questions or concerns about smoking cessation, don't hesitate to ask. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I think we've covered a lot of territory.\n\nNurse: I'm glad we could cover a lot of ground today.
