    "prompt": "Nurse: Chocolate cake sounds delicious, Mr. Valenzuela. Just remember to enjoy it in moderation and follow the low fiber diet guidelines. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to avoid those supplements and medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Do you have any questions about this or anything else related to your diet or supplements?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay about it, Mr. Valenzuela. It's true that most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. However, we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm here to help you prepare for this as best as possible. You don't have to do anything just yet, but you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure. This involves only drinking clear liquids, which means no solid foods, and drinking either clear or light-colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and perhaps you can tell me if you have any questions about the diet?",
