Is it okay if we review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure now?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Okay, thank you, Mr. O'Leary. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Right knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, thank you for confirming, Mr. O'Leary. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor.

Now, if you have someone accompanying you, we do have patient family lounges where they can comfortably wait.

They can provide support with affordable housing options. Feel free to reach out to our local social services or patient support groups for more information.\n\nAre there any other questions you have at this point?",
