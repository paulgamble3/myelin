    "prompt": "Patient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Okay, thank you, Mr. O'Leary. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Right knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, thank you for confirming, Mr. O'Leary. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. O'Leary. I'm glad to hear that the logistics work for you. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect, Mr. O'Leary. Now, should you or your family need some rest during your hospital stay, we have family lounges with comfortable seating, refreshments, and other amenities. We also understand the importance of planning for accommodation in advance, given that you're having surgery. Local charities and organizations can provide support for families in need of accommodation during a medical crisis, should you need it. Do you have any questions about this?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. O'Leary. I'm glad to hear that everything seems clear to you. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. But before we do, I want to make sure you're ready. Can we proceed?"
