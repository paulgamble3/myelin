    "prompt": "Patient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. O'Leary. I'm glad to hear that the logistics work for you. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. I'm glad to hear that everything seems clear to you. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. But before we do, I want to make sure you're ready. Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I'm ready. Let's do it.\n\nNurse: Perfect, thank you, Mr. O'Leary. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day. As per the instructions, you were supposed to stop this medication 7 days before the procedure. Have you already stopped taking your Aspirin?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't because I do not wanna have another stroke.",

        "gpt4": "I see, Mr. O'Leary. It must be quite concerning to balance your surgical preparation with the prevention of another stroke event. The instructions for your upcoming Total Knee Replacement procedure suggest stopping Aspirin 81 mg once a day, 7 days before the procedure. Today is August 10th, and your scheduled surgery is on August 13th. Thus it's important that you stop taking Aspirin 81 mg from today onwards. However, please communicate with your doctor any concerns you have regarding stopping this medication. \n\nMay I check if there are any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners that you are taking, Mr. O'Leary?",
        "our_model": "I understand your concern, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to remember that these instructions are designed to ensure your safety during the surgery. However, I would recommend discussing your concerns with Doctor Stevens or another member of your healthcare team. They can provide more detailed information about why it's necessary to stop the Aspirin and how it will affect your health. Do you have any other questions about this medication?"
