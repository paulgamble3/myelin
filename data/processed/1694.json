    "prompt": "Nurse: Perfect, thank you, Mr. O'Leary. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day. As per the instructions, you were supposed to stop this medication 7 days before the procedure. Have you already stopped taking your Aspirin?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't because I do not wanna have another stroke.\n\nNurse: I understand your concern, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to remember that these instructions are designed to ensure your safety during the surgery. However, I would recommend discussing your concerns with Doctor Stevens or another member of your healthcare team. They can provide more detailed information about why it's necessary to stop the Aspirin and how it will affect your health. Do you have any other questions about this medication?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. O'Leary. It's critical to avoid those medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Now, I notice that you've also been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
