    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand your concern, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to remember that these instructions are designed to ensure your safety during the surgery. However, I would recommend discussing your concerns with Doctor Stevens or another member of your healthcare team. They can provide more detailed information about why it's necessary to stop the Aspirin and how it will affect your health. Do you have any other questions about this medication?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. O'Leary. It's critical to avoid those medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Now, I notice that you've also been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these or any other medications?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. O'Leary. Now, let's move on to another important part of your pre-surgery preparation: the use of a chlorhexidine scrub. This is used to cleanse your skin prior to the surgery and helps to reduce the risk of infection. Have you purchased this scrub yet?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. O'Leary. If any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to discussing how to prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased a chlorhexidine scrub?"
