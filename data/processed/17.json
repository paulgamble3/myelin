        "gpt4": "Sure. Aspart stands for Aspartate aminotransferase, which is an enzyme found in different parts of your body. It's typically measured in a normal lab test to check the health of certain organs. However, in this case, the Aspart we've been referring to is NovoLog or Insulin aspart. Insulin aspart is a prescription drug used to control high blood sugar in adults and children with diabetes. It's measured by 'units'. For example, you're currently prescribed Insulin Aspart at a dosage of 5 units three times a day. This helps to keep your blood sugar levels in a more normal range. Does that help clarify things for you?",
        "our_model": "Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain. Aspart is a type of protein that is found in your blood. It's used to measure how well your kidneys are working. The normal range for Aspart is between 65 and 170 units per liter. Your recent Aspart level was 1.0 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. This means your kidneys are functioning well. Does that help clarify things for you?"
