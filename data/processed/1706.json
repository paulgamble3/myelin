        "gpt4": "The long-term outlook for Congestive Heart Failure, or CHF, can vary greatly from person to person. It largely depends on factors like the stage of the disease, the individual's overall health, and how well they can manage their condition. Following your doctor's recommended treatment plans, eating a heart-healthy diet, exercising regularly, and monitoring your symptoms closely can play significant roles in managing CHF. It's crucial to remember that everyone's experience with CHF is unique, so personal outlooks can vary significantly. Does that help, Mr. O'Leary?",
