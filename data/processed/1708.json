    "prompt": "Nurse: That's excellent, Mr. O'Leary. It's important to have someone there to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any questions you have, feel free to ask now. [\n\nPatient: I have a question.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. O'Leary. What's your question?\n\nPatient: What is the long term outlook for CHF?\n\nNurse: That's a very important question, Mr. O'Leary. The long-term outlook for congestive heart failure, or CHF, can vary greatly from person to person. It depends on many factors, including how well you manage your condition, how well your heart responds to treatment, and how quickly any underlying conditions are treated.\n\nPatient: And can the condition be reversed or cared over time?\n\nNurse: That's a very insightful question, Mr. O'Leary. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a condition where the heart doesn't pump blood as well as it should. While it can't be cured, it can be managed with lifestyle changes and medication. This includes maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and taking prescribed medications. Over time, these steps can help improve your heart's function and your overall quality of life. It's important to follow your doctor's advice and keep up with your treatment plan. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "our_model": "I'm glad I could provide the information you needed, Mr. O'Leary. Now, before we wrap up, I want to summarize what you still need to do before your procedure. You need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. You also need to remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?"
