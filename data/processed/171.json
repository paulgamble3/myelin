    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay about it, Mr. Valenzuela. It's true that most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. However, we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. Remember, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's important to note that you should avoid any beverages or gelatin that are red or purple. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: Not that I can think of now.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you think of any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad to hear you're open to tips, Mr. Valenzuela. Some people find that the laxative solution is easier to drink when it's cold. Additionally, using a straw can help it go down easier. Keep in mind that everyone's experience is different. Some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. Do you have any further questions about the bowel prep or how to make it easier?",
