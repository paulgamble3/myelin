    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely, Ms. Winner. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve pain and help you regain function in your knee, which includes moving around. You should be able to walk with the aid of a walker or crutches within a day\n\nPatient: after the surgery without paying how much much pain am I gonna be in?\n\nNurse: Those are very important questions, Ms. Winner. After a total knee replacement, most patients experience immediate relief from the severe pain they had before surgery. However, it's normal to have some pain after the procedure. This is usually controlled with medications. As for mobility, you'll start moving around with the help of a physical therapist within a day or two after surgery. Over time, with physical therapy and exercises, you should regain your mobility and strength. Remember, everyone's recovery process is different, and it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that help address your concerns?\n\nPatient: A little bit.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Winner. Remember, you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. Winner. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
