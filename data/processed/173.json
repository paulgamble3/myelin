    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's important to note that you should avoid any beverages or gelatin that are red or purple. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: Not that I can think of now.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you think of any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Here are a couple of tips that might make the bowel prep easier for you. First, you can drink the laxative solution cold. This can make it more palatable. Second, you can drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: They're good. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad you found the tips helpful. Do you have any other questions about the bowel prep or is there anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Remember, some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the next part of the prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Does that sound okay to you?",
