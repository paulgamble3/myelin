It's go.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Winner, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please confirm if it's okay for us to discuss your medications?\n\nPatient: I said, yeah. Let's go.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. Winner. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance 25 mg two times a day, Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg two times a day, Atorvastatin 20 mg once a day, and Ozempic 2 mg once a week. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Winner. Are you taking any other medications that we haven't discussed yet, such as over-the-counter medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "That's good to know, Ms. Winner. It's important to avoid such medications unless your doctor has advised you otherwise as they could increase the risk of bleeding during your knee replacement procedure. Regarding your post-procedure medications, I notice on your chart that Tylenol and Celebrex have been prescribed. Have you picked these up yet from your pharmacy?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Ms. Winner. I also see that you've been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Celebrex 100 mg two times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications from the pharmacy yet?"
