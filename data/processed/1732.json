Let's go.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. Winner. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance 25 mg two times a day, Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg two times a day, Atorvastatin 20 mg once a day, and Ozempic 2 mg once a week. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Winner. Are you taking any other medications that we haven't discussed yet, such as over-the-counter medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Winner. I also see that you've been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Celebrex 100 mg two times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
