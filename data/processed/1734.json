    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Winner. Are you taking any other medications that we haven't discussed yet, such as over-the-counter medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Winner. I also see that you've been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Celebrex 100 mg two times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, Ms. Winner. It's important to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medications you're currently taking?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Winner. If any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to discuss how to prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased a chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: Yep.",

        "gpt4": "Excellent, Ms. Winner. It's very crucial for your procedure. Here's how you should use it:\n\nThe night before your procedure, and again in the morning before you leave for the hospital, you'll need to use the scrub. What you'll want to do is first take a shower as you normally would. Then, with the water off, you're going to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub your body from the neck down. \n\nDoes that make sense so far?",
        "our_model": "That's excellent, Ms. Winner. You're well-prepared. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?"
