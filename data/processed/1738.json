    "prompt": "Nurse: That's excellent, Ms. Winner. You're well-prepared. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Great, Ms. Winner. After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Ms. Winner. Finally, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Ms. Winner. Finally, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: I don't actually get out of the shower.",

        "gpt4": "That's okay, Ms. Winner. After taking a regular shower, you can turn off the water in the shower, then use the chlorhexidine scrub while still in the shower. After scrubbing gently for 5 minutes, you can then turn the water back on to rinse off the solution. Remember to pat dry with a clean towel afterward. Would that work for you?",
        "our_model": "I'm sorry for any confusion, Ms. Winner. You're correct. You should stay in the shower for the scrubbing process. After your normal shower, you'll apply the scrub to a wet washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. Does that make sense?"
