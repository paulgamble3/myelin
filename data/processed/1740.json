Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Ms. Winner. Finally, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: I don't actually get out of the shower.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry for any confusion, Ms. Winner. You're correct. You should stay in the shower for the scrubbing process. After your normal shower, you'll apply the scrub to a wet washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Great, Ms. Winner. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Okay.",
