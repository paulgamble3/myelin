    "prompt": "Nurse: Perfect, Ms. Winner. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Winner. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. Not really.\n\nNurse: Okay, Ms. Winner. I appreciate your patience. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness. Do you currently have a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Winner. It's important to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",

Now, the last logistic question I have for you today is: Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure? It's of utmost importance that you are not alone immediately following your procedure.",
