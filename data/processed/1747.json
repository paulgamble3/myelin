It's critical to have someone to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to arrange, remember you still have time.

        "gpt4": "Alright, Ms. Winner. I think that covers all the topics for today. Let's quickly go through what you still need to do before your procedure. \n\nFirstly, remember to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Secondly, you must not eat or drink anything after midnight prior to your procedure. Also, please continue to monitor your health, and call us if you have any signs of illness. None noted at this time, correct? \n\nLast but not least, remember to take your necessary medications as directed, unless your doctor tells you to stop.\n\nI'm confident that you will do everything needed for your preparation. Is all of this clear, Ms. Winner? Can I count on you to do all of this?",
