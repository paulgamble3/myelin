    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful, Ms. Winner. It's always best to recover in the comfort of your own home. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Winner. It's critical to have someone to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to arrange, remember you still have time. Do you have any questions about the post-procedure plans?\n\nPatient: Thank\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Ms. Winner. It's important to have someone there to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any questions you have, feel free to ask now. [\n\nPatient: No. I don't have any questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Winner. I believe we've covered all the necessary topics for today. Just to summarize, you'll need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure, and remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sure.",
