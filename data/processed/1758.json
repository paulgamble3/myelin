    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear you're taking this step to take care of your health. It's important to remember that preventative screenings like this can help detect potential issues early. Would it be alright if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes, please. Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll also have another call the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our list. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions leading up to your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Can you remind me?\n\nNurse: Of course. You'll need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before your procedure. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello, but avoid anything red or purple. You'll also need to take a bowel prep medication, which will help clean out your colon. This is crucial for the procedure. Does that help?\n\nPatient: Understood.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Of course.",
