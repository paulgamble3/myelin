    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yeah. You don't need to ask. It's okay.\n\nNurse: Thank you for your patience. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. There's no need to stop this medication before your colonoscopy. Are you taking any other medications we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. It's critical to note that medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications?\n\nPatient: That's\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: I actually just put down my pan. So I didn't say anything.",
