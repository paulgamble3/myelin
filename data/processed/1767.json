Let's move on to the next topic. Do you have any questions about your medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This includes foods like white bread, rice, and pasta, and you should avoid high fiber foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: Pretty straightforward to me.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. It's essential to stick to this diet to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy?\n\nPatient: Chicken.",
