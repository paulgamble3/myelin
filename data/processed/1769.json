    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This includes foods like white bread, rice, and pasta, and you should avoid high fiber foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: Pretty straightforward to me.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. It's essential to stick to this diet to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy?\n\nPatient: Chicken.\n\nNurse: Chicken is a great choice, especially if it's cooked without the skin or any high-fiber stuffing. It's lean and easy to digest. Do you usually prepare it in a specific way?\n\nPatient: Mashed potatoes,\n\nNurse: Those are excellent choices. Chicken and mashed potatoes are both low in fiber and can be quite comforting. Do you usually prepare them in a specific way?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",

        "gpt4": "That sounds delicious! Eating the foods you love during this time can help the process feel less restrictive. It's unlike other times where doctors would advise their patients to eat high fiber foods. Now, on to the next topic: supplements. Starting today, you'll also need to stop any supplements like Psyllium husk and any anti-diarrheal medications you take. Do you currently take any of these?",
        "our_model": "That's great. It's a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Now, let's move on to the next topic. You'll also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?"
