        "gpt4": "Perfect. It seems you're quite prepared for this phase, which is splendid. To ensure thorough preparation, it's important to remember that you should start your bowel prep 24 hours before the procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This means no solid foods and sticking to clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids entail?",
