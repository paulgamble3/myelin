    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Mr. Jimenez. The goal of a total knee replacement is to help you regain movement in your knee and reduce pain. Physical therapy will be a crucial part of your recovery\n\nPatient: around without pain after the surgery.\n\nNurse: Again, that's a very common concern, Mr. Jimenez. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve the pain in the knee caused by damage to the joint. After surgery and rehabilitation, most people are able to move around with little to no pain. However, it's important to remember that recovery times can vary, and it might take some time before you're completely free of pain. Before we move on, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Jimenez. If you have any questions at any point during our conversation, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help you. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Okay, thank you, Mr. Jimenez. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Right knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine.",
