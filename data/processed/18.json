    "prompt": "Patient: Yes. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Lastly, it's important to limit alcohol and quit smoking, if applicable. These lifestyle changes can have a significant impact on your blood pressure. Do these suggestions sound manageable to you?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: I actually do.\n\nPatient: Can you tell me what Aspart means and how it is measure?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain. Aspart is a type of protein that is found in your blood. It's used to measure how well your kidneys are working. The normal range for Aspart is between 65 and 170 units per liter. Your recent Aspart level was 1.0 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. This means your kidneys are functioning well. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Can you tell me what?",
