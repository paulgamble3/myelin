Yeah.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Mr. Jimenez. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Jimenez. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yeah. It's fine.\n\nNurse: Excellent, thank you, Mr. Jimenez. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol, Celebrex, and Atorvastatin. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Good to know, Mr. Jimenez. Just for your general knowledge, some patients are asked to stop certain medication prior to their surgery. However, I see no medication changes for you at this time. Remember to take your medication as prescribed unless instructed otherwise. Are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?",
        "our_model": "That's great to hear, Mr. Jimenez. It's critical to follow your medication regimen as prescribed. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?"
