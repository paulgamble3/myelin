I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yeah. It's fine.\n\nNurse: Excellent, thank you, Mr. Jimenez. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol, Celebrex, and Atorvastatin.

I also see that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?"
