    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Jimenez. It's critical to follow your medication regimen as prescribed. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to know, Mr. Jimenez. It's essential to avoid certain medications like blood thinners before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also see that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: I'm going to later today.\n\nNurse: That's a good plan, Mr. Jimenez. It's important to have your post-procedure medication ready. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No. Nothing else.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Jimenez. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to discuss how to prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: She said, yes, I have.",

        "gpt4": "That's wonderful, Mr. Jimenez. Having the scrub on hand is a good start. Let's walk through the instructions step by step to ensure you're well-prepared on how to use it. First, you'll need to use this scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. What you'll do is take a shower like you normally would and then turn the water off. Does this sound doable so far?",
