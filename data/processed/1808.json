    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to know, Mr. Jimenez. It's essential to avoid certain medications like blood thinners before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also see that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: I'm going to later today.\n\nNurse: That's a good plan, Mr. Jimenez. It's important to have your post-procedure medication ready. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No. Nothing else.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Jimenez. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to discuss how to prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: She said, yes, I have.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Jimenez. You're well-prepared. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",

        "gpt4": "Very well. After that, Mr. Jimenez, you'll need to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth. Then, you'll gently scrub yourself from the neck down with it. Please be sure to avoid your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you confirm that you would be comfortable doing that?",
