    "prompt": "Nurse: That's correct, Mr. Jimenez. You should not have any food or drink, including water, after midnight before your procedure. This is to ensure your stomach is empty for the anesthesia. Do you have any other questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Jimenez. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Jimenez. I appreciate your patience. Now, I'd like to ask if you have any signs of illness. Do you currently have a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: I'm a little achy.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling achy, Mr. Jimenez. It's not uncommon to feel some aches and pains before a procedure, especially with the condition of your knee. However, if you notice any significant changes in your symptoms or if you develop a fever, please contact your doctor immediately. Can I count on you to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
