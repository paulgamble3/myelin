    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Jimenez. It's important to keep your healthcare team informed. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yes. It is. Definitely.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Jimenez. Going home after the procedure is usually the best for recovery, as it allows you to rest in a familiar and comfortable environment. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Jimenez. It's essential to have someone to assist you after the procedure, as you may still be feeling the effects of the anesthesia and may need help with daily activities. If there's anything else you need to discuss, feel free to let me know. [\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Jimenez. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "I am glad to hear that, Mr. Jimenez. Based on our conversation, the remaining steps for you are to continue taking your medications as prescribed, use the skin scrub the night before and the morning of your surgery, and remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Jimenez. Before we end the call, let's summarize what you still need to do before your procedure. You need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure, and remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?"
