    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great question, Ms. Odonnell. With your Stage IIIA CKD, it's important to monitor for symptoms such as swelling in your hands, feet, or ankles, changes in urination like frothy or bubbly urine, or any sudden weight gain or loss. If you notice any of these, please let your doctor know. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?\n\nPatient: worsening kidney function or complications.\n\nNurse: Yes, that's correct, Ms. Odonnell. Also, changes in urination like frothy or bubbly urine, or a decrease in the amount of urine could be signs to watch for. If you notice any of these, it's important to let your doctor know. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we move on?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Odonnell. If it's okay with you, I'd like to go over a few topics to check on how you're doing. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Ms. Odonnell. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yes. It was one hundred twenty one today.",
