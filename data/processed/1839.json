Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Ms. Odonnell. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yes. It was one hundred twenty one today.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Odonnell. A blood sugar level of 121 is a bit higher than the target range. Would it be alright if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Odonnell, could you please confirm if your blood sugar level was high or low?\n\nPatient: I said it was one hundred twenty one.",
