        "gpt4": "Thank you! It's important to make sure you're eating a diet low in sugar and high in fiber. Regular exercise is also key in managing diabetes. You're already being active with your zumba class, which is great. Try to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. Do you feel like you're able to manage that, Ms. Odonnell?\n",
