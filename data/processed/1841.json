        "gpt4": "Perfect, I'm glad to hear you found that helpful. It's also important to stay active, as you're already doing with your Zumba classes. Exercise can increase insulin sensitivity and help your muscles utilize sugar for energy. But remember, safety first! Always stay hydrated, warm up before your workout, and cool down afterwards. How does this sound to you?",
        "our_model": "I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Odonnell. Another suggestion is to stay active, like you are with your Zumba classes. Regular physical activity can help your body use insulin more effectively. Do you think you could try to incorporate more physical activity into your daily routine, if possible?"
