    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Odonnell, could you please confirm if your blood sugar level was high or low?\n\nPatient: I said it was one hundred twenty one.\n\nNurse: Give me a moment to check how I can best support you. Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you. Thank you for confirming that, Ms. Odonnell. A blood sugar level of 121 is a bit higher than the target range. Would it be alright if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. Odonnell. One strategy to help manage your blood sugar levels is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, and incorporating a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: That sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Odonnell. Another suggestion is to stay active, like you are with your Zumba classes. Regular physical activity can help your body use insulin more effectively. Do you think you could try to incorporate more physical activity into your daily routine, if possible?\n\nPatient: I can try. Yeah.",
