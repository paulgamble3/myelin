    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you, Ms. Odonnell. One strategy to help manage your blood sugar levels is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, and incorporating a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: That sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Odonnell. Another suggestion is to stay active, like you are with your Zumba classes. Regular physical activity can help your body use insulin more effectively. Do you think you could try to incorporate more physical activity into your daily routine, if possible?\n\nPatient: I can try. Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Odonnell. Remember, even small changes can make a big difference. Now, let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure measurement, and what was the result?\n\nPatient: Alright. It was one twenty over eighty.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Odonnell. A blood pressure reading of 120 over 80 is within the normal range, which is good news. It's essential to keep monitoring it regularly. Can I share some suggestions about managing blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Okay.",
