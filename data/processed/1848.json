What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: That sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Odonnell. Another suggestion is to maintain a healthy weight. Regular physical activity, like your Zumba classes, can help with this. Do you think you could try to incorporate these suggestions into your lifestyle?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Ms. Odonnell. Remember, every little bit helps when it comes to managing blood pressure. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Odonnell. If you ever have any questions about your lab results, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Apixaban 5 mg oral tablet, 10 mg once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
