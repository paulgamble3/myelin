    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Odonnell. You're doing a fantastic job managing your medications. Remember, there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for CKD patients to take. It's essential to talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Odonnell. If you ever have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Oh,\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Odonnell, you were saying something about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: Well, you know, I have a question about that because I'm on a low phosphorus diet.\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Odonnell. I'd be happy to help answer your question. What would you like to know about your low phosphorus diet?\n\nPatient: Foods should I avoid? On this diet?",

        "gpt4": "That's a great question, Ms. Odonnell. On a low-phosphorus diet, you should try to avoid foods that are high in phosphorus. These include dairy products like milk and cheese, processed foods, and cola drinks. Also, certain whole grains and nuts can be high in phosphorus. Protein-rich foods like meat, poultry, and fish can also be high in phosphorus, but your body needs protein, so balancing intake is important. Do you think you can make some changes based on these guidelines?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question, Ms. Odonnell. On a low phosphorus diet, it's generally recommended to limit foods high in phosphorus. These include dairy products, beans, lentils, nuts, and whole grains. Also, some processed foods and drinks have added phosphorus. Would it be alright if I provide some more detailed information about this?"
