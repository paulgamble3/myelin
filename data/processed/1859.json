    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great question, Ms. Odonnell. On a low phosphorus diet, it's generally recommended to limit foods high in phosphorus. These include dairy products, beans, lentils, nuts, and whole grains. Also, some processed foods and drinks have added phosphorus. Would it be alright if I provide some more detailed information about this?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. Odonnell. It's also recommended to avoid certain types of alcohol, like beer, which is often high in phosphorus. Instead, you might consider wine or spirits. Also, some types of fish, like sardines and canned tuna, can be high in phosphorus. It's often found in the bones, so you might want to choose fish without bones. What do you think about these suggestions?\n\nPatient: Who?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Odonnell, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: I think it's manageable. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Ms. Odonnell. I'm glad to hear that you find these suggestions manageable. Remember, it's all about balance and making small changes. Now, let's move on to your sodium intake. It's recommended to limit sodium to less than 2000 mg per day. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Oh, I've today, I had some",
