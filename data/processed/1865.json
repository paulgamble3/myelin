    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Odonnell. Shrimp tacos can be a part of a balanced diet, but it's important to be mindful of the sodium content, especially in the tortillas and any sauces or seasonings used. Would it be alright if I provide some suggestions on how to make your meals healthier?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. Odonnell. One suggestion is to use low-sodium tortillas and fillings. You could also try to limit the amount of sauces and seasonings, as they often contain added sodium. What do you think about these suggestions?\n\nPatient: That sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Odonnell. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Now, let's discuss your carbohydrate intake. It's recommended to limit carbohydrates to 130 grams per day.
