Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: One twenty eight.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Aguirre. A blood sugar level of 128 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: What is the target range?\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion earlier, Ms. Aguirre. You mentioned that your last blood sugar reading was 128. This is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes, which is usually under 120. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Okay.",
