    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your kidney disease now?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Since you have Stage I CKD, it's important to monitor your blood pressure regularly. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was?\n\nPatient: One twenty two over eighty two.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's great that you're keeping track of your blood pressure. It's a bit high, but not too far off. Would you like some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent. One strategy is to reduce your salt intake. Too much salt can raise your blood pressure. Another is to maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight can also increase blood pressure. Lastly, regular physical activity can help lower your blood pressure. Do you think these are strategies you could incorporate into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
