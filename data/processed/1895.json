Are my sodium and potassium levels normal?\n\nNurse: Yes, your sodium level is 139 mEq/L and your potassium level is 3.9 mEq/L. Both of these are within the normal range. Sodium and potassium are important for your body to function properly, so it's good that your levels are normal. Do you have any other questions about your lab results?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright. Let's move on to your medications. You're currently taking Cellcept 500 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 1000 mg two times a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Taking your medication as prescribed is crucial for managing your conditions. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No.",
