    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. Taking your medication as prescribed is crucial for managing your conditions. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's important to take your medication as prescribed to manage your conditions effectively. Now, I'd like to remind you that there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for patients with CKD to take. Always talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about your diet. Can you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Let's see. I'll eat eggs. Salad, chicken, quinoa, brown rice, things like that.\n\nNurse: It sounds like you're making some healthy choices with your meals. Eggs, salad, chicken, quinoa, and brown rice are all good options. Do you mind if I provide some suggestions to further align your diet with your health needs?\n\nPatient: I was gonna ask, What dietary changes can I make to preserve my kidney function?",

        "gpt4": "You're already doing a great job by consuming healthy and balanced meals. Here are a few additional suggestions: try to limit your salt intake to 2,300 mg per day and choose fresh foods over processed ones to avoid added sodium. Keep your protein intake balanced. Too much can be hard on your kidneys. For CKD patients, it's also important to monitor your intake of potassium, phosphorus, and calcium, so try to talk to a dietitian who could personalize your diet plan. Would you like any additional dietary recommendations?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question. For your kidney health, it's beneficial to limit your intake of sodium and potassium. Foods like eggs, chicken, and quinoa are generally low in these minerals. However, some salads and brown rice can be high in potassium. It's also important to stay hydrated, but not overdo it, as too much fluid can be hard on your kidneys. Would you like more detailed dietary recommendations?"
