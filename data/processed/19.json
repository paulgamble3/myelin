    "prompt": "Patient: Yes. It does.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: I actually do.\n\nPatient: Can you tell me what Aspart means and how it is measure?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain. Aspart is a type of protein that is found in your blood. It's used to measure how well your kidneys are working. The normal range for Aspart is between 65 and 170 units per liter. Your recent Aspart level was 1.0 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. This means your kidneys are functioning well. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Can you tell me what?\n\nNurse: Of course.\n\nPatient: G f r means, and how is that measure?",

        "gpt4": "Yes, I can explain that. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a measure of how well your kidneys are working. It tells us how much blood is filtered by your kidneys per minute. The normal value for GFR can vary depending on your age, sex, and body size, but generally, it's above 90 mL/min/1.73m2. Your recent GFR was 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates a moderate decrease in kidney function. This is consistent with your Stage IIIB Chronic Kidney Disease. Is there anything else related to your labs that you're curious about?",
        "our_model": "Of course. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. A GFR below 60 for three months or more may mean kidney disease. Your recent GFR was 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which is a bit lower than the normal range. This is something your doctor will continue to monitor. Does that help?"
