    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about your diet. Can you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Let's see. I'll eat eggs. Salad, chicken, quinoa, brown rice, things like that.\n\nNurse: It sounds like you're making some healthy choices with your meals. Eggs, salad, chicken, quinoa, and brown rice are all good options. Do you mind if I provide some suggestions to further align your diet with your health needs?\n\nPatient: I was gonna ask, What dietary changes can I make to preserve my kidney function?\n\nNurse: That's a great question. For your kidney health, it's beneficial to limit your intake of sodium and potassium. Foods like eggs, chicken, and quinoa are generally low in these minerals. However, some salads and brown rice can be high in potassium. It's also important to stay hydrated, but not overdo it, as too much fluid can be hard on your kidneys. Would you like more detailed dietary recommendations?\n\nPatient: That's alright.\n\nNurse: Alright. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's talk about your other chronic condition, Lupus. How have you been managing with that?\n\nPatient: It's been alright.",
