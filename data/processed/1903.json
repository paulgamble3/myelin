How have you been managing with that?\n\nPatient: It's been alright.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you're managing well. It's critical to keep an eye on any symptoms that might indicate a flare-up, such as fatigue, joint pain, or rashes. Are you experiencing any of these symptoms currently?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to keep up with your medication and any recommended lifestyle changes to manage your Lupus. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or vape?\n\nPatient: I smoke a pack of cigarettes today.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. I know it's not easy to talk about, but it's important for your health. Have you ever considered quitting smoking?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not interested in it.",
