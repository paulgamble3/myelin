We have a few topics to cover today. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. Let's start with your medications. Are you still taking your Valsartan, Lasix, and Metformin?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. And how are you taking them?\n\nPatient: Orally?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Sam, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: Like, I'm taking them or only, like, through my tablet and mouse.",
