And how are you taking them?\n\nPatient: Orally?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Sam, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: Like, I'm taking them or only, like, through my tablet and mouse.\n\nNurse: I see, thank you for clarifying. It's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No. I'm pretty good about thinking I'm in.",
