    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Sam, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: Like, I'm taking them or only, like, through my tablet and mouse.\n\nNurse: I see, thank you for clarifying. It's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No. I'm pretty good about thinking I'm in.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. You're doing a fantastic job managing your medications. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Of course.\n\nNurse: Thank you. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: No.",
