Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's great. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to do this at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: Yeah. You asked me so many questions. How do I remember Which one? To us myself for the future.\n\nNurse: I understand your concern. It can be a lot to remember. One way to keep track is to write down your symptoms each day. You can use a notebook or a symptom tracker app on your phone. This can help you notice any changes over time. Would you like me to send you some resources on how to track your symptoms?\n\nPatient: That would be lovely. I didn't know they got some some traffic there.",
