        "gpt4": "Absolutely, Ms. Aguirre. Let me provide more detail. Regular physical activity, such as 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week, can help manage blood sugar levels. This could consist of 30 minutes of brisk walking five days a week. Additionally, engaging in resistance training, such as using weights or resistance bands, at least twice a week can also help.
