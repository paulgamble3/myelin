    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. Can you share more about the types of carbohydrates you're including in your meals?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I'll do some potatoes, but I think it's better to call.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. Potatoes and corn are both carbohydrates. As part of your dietary recommendations, you're advised to control your carbohydrate intake to 130 grams per day. This includes all sources of carbohydrates, not just potatoes and corn. Would it be okay if I share some more dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. So, Rachel, I have one question.\n\nNurse: Of course. What's your question?\n\nPatient: In butter, a carb?\n\nNurse: Yes, butter is not a carbohydrate. It's a fat. However, it's important to use it in moderation as part of a balanced diet. Would you like more information on how to balance your diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great! Here are some simple guidelines. Your diet should consist of:\n\n1. Fruits and Vegetables: Aim to make fruits and vegetables half your plate. They are low in calories and packed with nutrients.\n\n2. Protein: Choose lean sources of protein like chicken, fish, and low-fat dairy products.\n\n3. Grains: Make at least half your grains whole grains, such as whole wheat bread and brown rice.\n\n4. Fats: Choose healthy fats such as olive oil and avocado, and be mindful of portion sizes as fats are calorie-dense.\n\nAs for specific diet recommendations, your doctor mentioned that you should also be limiting your sodium intake to less than 1500 mg per day. Are there any questions about what we've talked about, or is there something else you're interested in?",
        "our_model": "Wonderful. In addition to controlling your carbohydrate intake, it's also recommended to follow a cardiac diet. This means limiting your intake of sodium, saturated fats, and cholesterol. It's also important to include a variety of foods in your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?"
