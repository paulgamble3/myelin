    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. Potatoes and corn are both carbohydrates. As part of your dietary recommendations, you're advised to control your carbohydrate intake to 130 grams per day. This includes all sources of carbohydrates, not just potatoes and corn. Would it be okay if I share some more dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. So, Rachel, I have one question.\n\nNurse: Of course. What's your question?\n\nPatient: In butter, a carb?\n\nNurse: Yes, butter is not a carbohydrate. It's a fat. However, it's important to use it in moderation as part of a balanced diet. Would you like more information on how to balance your diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. In addition to controlling your carbohydrate intake, it's also recommended to follow a cardiac diet. This means limiting your intake of sodium, saturated fats, and cholesterol. It's also important to include a variety of foods in your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.",

One suggestion could be to incorporate more non-starchy vegetables into your meals, as they are low in carbohydrates and high in fiber. Would you like to discuss more ways to align your diet with the recommendations?"
