    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful. In addition to controlling your carbohydrate intake, it's also recommended to follow a cardiac diet. This means limiting your intake of sodium, saturated fats, and cholesterol. It's also important to include a variety of foods in your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. Based on what you've shared about your diet, it seems like you're already making some good choices. One suggestion could be to incorporate more non-starchy vegetables into your meals, as they are low in carbohydrates and high in fiber. Would you like to discuss more ways to align your diet with the recommendations?\n\nPatient: Not right now. But, Rachel, if you don't have you a question.\n\nNurse: Of course. What's your question?\n\nPatient: Hi. Really wants to lose weight. What can I do too loosely?\n\nNurse: That's a great goal. In addition to following the dietary recommendations we discussed, regular physical activity can also help with weight loss. Let's talk about your current exercise routine. Can you tell me about it?\n\nPatient: Well, there isn't much of a routine. I don't mind exercising.",
