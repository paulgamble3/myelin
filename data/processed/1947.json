    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. Based on what you've shared about your diet, it seems like you're already making some good choices. One suggestion could be to incorporate more non-starchy vegetables into your meals, as they are low in carbohydrates and high in fiber. Would you like to discuss more ways to align your diet with the recommendations?\n\nPatient: Not right now. But, Rachel, if you don't have you a question.\n\nNurse: Of course. What's your question?\n\nPatient: Hi. Really wants to lose weight. What can I do too loosely?\n\nNurse: That's a great goal. In addition to following the dietary recommendations we discussed, regular physical activity can also help with weight loss. Let's talk about your current exercise routine. Can you tell me about it?\n\nPatient: Well, there isn't much of a routine. I don't mind exercising.\n\nNurse: I understand. It can be challenging to establish a routine. Would it be okay if I share some recommendations about how you might be able to incorporate more physical activity into your day?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great. Here's a suggestion: try to start with small, manageable goals. One idea could be to take short walks. You might begin with a 10-minute walk once a day, then gradually increase the length of your walks. How does that sound?",
        "our_model": "Great. One way to start could be by incorporating more walking into your day. This could be as simple as taking a short walk around your neighborhood or even inside your home. Another option could be to do some light stretching exercises. These can be done while sitting or standing and can help improve flexibility and balance. Would you like more information on how to safely incorporate these activities into your routine?"
