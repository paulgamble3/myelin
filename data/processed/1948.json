    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course. What's your question?\n\nPatient: Hi. Really wants to lose weight. What can I do too loosely?\n\nNurse: That's a great goal. In addition to following the dietary recommendations we discussed, regular physical activity can also help with weight loss. Let's talk about your current exercise routine. Can you tell me about it?\n\nPatient: Well, there isn't much of a routine. I don't mind exercising.\n\nNurse: I understand. It can be challenging to establish a routine. Would it be okay if I share some recommendations about how you might be able to incorporate more physical activity into your day?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great. One way to start could be by incorporating more walking into your day. This could be as simple as taking a short walk around your neighborhood or even inside your home. Another option could be to do some light stretching exercises. These can be done while sitting or standing and can help improve flexibility and balance. Would you like more information on how to safely incorporate these activities into your routine?\n\nPatient: Yes. I would.",

        "gpt4": "Alright. It's always a good idea to start slowly when beginning a new exercise routine and increase the intensity and duration over time. You might find it helpful to set small, achievable goals for yourself to stay motivated. Additionally, you should always listen to your body and stop exercising if you feel any pain or discomfort. This includes feeling out of breath, feeling dizzy, or having chest pain or discomfort. Would you like to discuss more exercise options that could help you achieve your goals?",
        "our_model": "Wonderful. Walking is a great low-impact exercise that can be done almost anywhere. You could start with a short walk around your neighborhood or even inside your home. As you feel more comfortable, you can gradually increase the distance or time you spend walking. Stretching exercises can also be beneficial. These can be done while sitting or standing and can help improve flexibility and balance. It's critical to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Do you have any questions about these suggestions?"
