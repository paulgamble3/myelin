    "prompt": "Nurse: Great. One way to start could be by incorporating more walking into your day. This could be as simple as taking a short walk around your neighborhood or even inside your home. Another option could be to do some light stretching exercises. These can be done while sitting or standing and can help improve flexibility and balance. Would you like more information on how to safely incorporate these activities into your routine?\n\nPatient: Yes. I would.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Walking is a great low-impact exercise that can be done almost anywhere. You could start with a short walk around your neighborhood or even inside your home. As you feel more comfortable, you can gradually increase the distance or time you spend walking. Stretching exercises can also be beneficial. These can be done while sitting or standing and can help improve flexibility and balance. It's critical to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Do you have any questions about these suggestions?\n\nPatient: I guess so.\n\nNurse: Alright. I understand that adjusting diet and exercise can be challenging.
