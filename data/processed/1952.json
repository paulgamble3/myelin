    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful. Walking is a great low-impact exercise that can be done almost anywhere. You could start with a short walk around your neighborhood or even inside your home. As you feel more comfortable, you can gradually increase the distance or time you spend walking. Stretching exercises can also be beneficial. These can be done while sitting or standing and can help improve flexibility and balance. It's critical to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Do you have any questions about these suggestions?\n\nPatient: I guess so.\n\nNurse: Alright. I understand that adjusting diet and exercise can be challenging. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: Hello. I was asking if you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far.\n\nPatient: No. I do not.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'll be sure to inform Doctor Rodriguez about our conversation and how you're doing. Before we end the call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: You know, I can't really think of any.",
