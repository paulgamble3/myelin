I'll be sure to inform Doctor Rodriguez about our conversation and how you're doing. Before we end the call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: You know, I can't really think of any.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. To summarize, you've agreed to consider incorporating more walking and stretching exercises into your routine, and to continue monitoring your symptoms. Can you confirm that you'll do these things?\n\nPatient: I'll get another shot.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Sam, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: I'll give it my best shot.",
