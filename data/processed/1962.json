I'm just worried about actually that I'm not going to be out of pain after the procedure, and I am curious about my pain after the procedure, do you have any inside?\n\nNurse: I see, you're concerned about the level of pain after the procedure. It's a common concern. After a total knee replacement, it's normal to experience some pain. However, the pain is usually well managed with medications. Your doctor and the team will work closely with you to ensure your comfort. Over time, as you heal, the pain will decrease. Is there anything specific you'd like to know about managing pain after the procedure?\n\nPatient: So you're saying it's gonna be managed with medications.\n\nNurse: Yes, that's correct. After your surgery, your doctor will prescribe medications to help manage your pain. These could include opioids, anti-inflammatories, or other types of pain relievers. The goal is to keep you as comfortable as possible while you heal. It's critical to remember that everyone's experience with pain after surgery is different, and your doctor will adjust your medication as needed to ensure your comfort. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your pain management after the procedure?\n\nPatient: I\n\nNurse: Yes, I'm here to help. What other questions or concerns do you have about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: I think I'm okay. I think I'm okay. Yeah. I'm just a little anxious for the day of the procedure",
