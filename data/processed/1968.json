    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a wonderful goal. Having a healthy body is something we all strive for. With your determination and the success rate of total knee replacements, which is around 90-95% still functioning well after 10 to 15 years, I'm confident you're on the right path. Do you have any specific activities or hobbies you're looking forward to doing once your knee is healed?\n\nPatient: I love what you said. Thank you, Rachel. Yeah. Just hiking.\n\nNurse: Hiking is a fantastic activity, especially for enjoying nature and staying active. It's great to hear that you're looking forward to getting back to it. Now, how are you feeling about your procedure?\n\nPatient: How are you?\n\nNurse: I'm here to assist you, so I don't have feelings, but I can tell you that it's normal to have some anxiety before a procedure. However, your surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, is highly experienced and will take great care of you. Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move on to the logistics of your procedure?\n\nPatient: No. We can move on.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the logistics then. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Mhmm. Sure.",

Just as a reminder, you're scheduled for a left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Dr. Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about an hour before your scheduled time, so please plan to be at the hospital by 8:00 AM. Does that work for you?",
