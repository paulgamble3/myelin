    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, I'm here to help with that. Let's review your medications one by one. You're currently taking Celebrex 100 mg oral capsule, two times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: I totally forget what my doctor said about aspirin.\n\nNurse: I see that you're currently taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day. However, you were instructed to stop this medication 7 days before the procedure. That means you should have stopped taking it yesterday, August 6th. Can you confirm if\n\nPatient: I haven't stopped taking it yet. Should I\n\nNurse: I see that you're currently taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day. As per the instructions, you were supposed to stop taking this medication 7 days before the procedure. That means you should have stopped taking it yesterday, August 6th. However, it's not too late to correct this. Please stop taking the Aspirin immediately and do not take any more before your surgery. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That makes sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. It's essential to follow these instructions for your surgery. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Great, that's important information for us to know as certain medication need to be stopped before a surgery like a knee replacement. Now, I see that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 5 mg and Tylenol 1000 mg for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy already?",
        "our_model": "That's good to hear. It's essential to avoid those medications before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Now, I notice that you've also been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these prescriptions from the pharmacy yet?"
