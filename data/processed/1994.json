    "prompt": "Nurse: I see that you're currently taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day. As per the instructions, you were supposed to stop taking this medication 7 days before the procedure. That means you should have stopped taking it yesterday, August 6th. However, it's not too late to correct this. Please stop taking the Aspirin immediately and do not take any more before your surgery. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That makes sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. It's essential to follow these instructions for your surgery. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to avoid those medications before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Now, I notice that you've also been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these prescriptions from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's critical to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Excellent. It sounds like you're on track with your medications. Now, let's talk about an important part of pre-surgery preparations: using a chlorhexidine scrub to reduce the possibility of infection. Do you already have this scrub? It's typically available over the counter at most pharmacies.",
        "our_model": "Alright, let's move on to the next topic. To prepare your skin for surgery and reduce the risk of infection, you'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?"
