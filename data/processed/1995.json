    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. It's essential to follow these instructions for your surgery. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to avoid those medications before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Now, I notice that you've also been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these prescriptions from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's critical to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the next topic. To prepare your skin for surgery and reduce the risk of infection, you'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.",

        "gpt4": "That's great. Now let's discuss how to use the scrub. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. You should first take a shower as you normally would, and then turn off the water. Do you have any questions so far?",
