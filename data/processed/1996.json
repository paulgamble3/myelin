    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to avoid those medications before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Now, I notice that you've also been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these prescriptions from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's critical to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the next topic. To prepare your skin for surgery and reduce the risk of infection, you'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, you're well-prepared. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great! After you turn the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. However, please avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Do you think you can do that?",
