Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Firstly, do you currently have any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.",
