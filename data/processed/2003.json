This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Firstly, do you currently have any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I see that your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure. Is that still correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. It's critical to have a plan for when you return home. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
