    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Firstly, do you currently have any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I see that your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure. Is that still correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. It's critical to have a plan for when you return home. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If for any reason that changes, remember you still have time to arrange it. Now, do you have any other questions or concerns about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: No.",
