    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I see that your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure. Is that still correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. It's critical to have a plan for when you return home. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If for any reason that changes, remember you still have time to arrange it. Now, do you have any other questions or concerns about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's summarize what you still need to do before your procedure. You need to stop taking Aspirin immediately, use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure, and remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
