    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If for any reason that changes, remember you still have time to arrange it. Now, do you have any other questions or concerns about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's summarize what you still need to do before your procedure. You need to stop taking Aspirin immediately, use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure, and remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful. Remember, I'm here for you every step of the way. If you have any questions at any time, you can call me back at 641-381-6523. I want to thank you for your time today. I hope your upcoming procedure goes smoothly and helps you get back to your normal activities, including your love for fishing. Take care and goodbye for now. [\n\nPatient: Can I ask you an unrelated question?\n\nNurse: Of course, you can ask any question you'd like. However, as an AI, my capabilities are limited to providing information and assistance related to healthcare and your upcoming procedure. What's your question?\n\nPatient: My question is about my weight.",
