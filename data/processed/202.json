    "prompt": "Nurse: My apologies for the confusion, Ms. Aguirre. As I was saying, some low-potassium and low-phosphorus foods could include apples, berries, and vegetables like cabbage and green beans. What do you think about this alternative suggestion?\n\nPatient: Well, I\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Aguirre, you were saying something?\n\nPatient: would like to eat more than just that.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Ms. Aguirre. It's important to have a varied diet. I apologize if it seemed like I was suggesting a limited menu. There are many other foods that can be included in a diet suitable for both your diabetes and kidney disease. For example, lean proteins like chicken or fish can be a good choice. Would you like me to provide more suggestions?\n\nPatient: I thought the doctor told me I had to watch how much protein I eat too.\n\nNurse: You're correct, Ms. Aguirre. With your kidney disease, it's important to monitor your protein intake. However, lean proteins like chicken or fish can still be part of a healthy diet in moderation. It's all about balance. Would you like me to note this for your care team to review and provide further guidance?\n\nPatient: Yes. Please.",
