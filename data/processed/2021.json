    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a wonderful goal. Walking without pain can significantly improve your quality of life. It's a simple pleasure that we often take for granted. Do you have a favorite place or route you're excited to walk again without pain?\n\nPatient: Cool. I just walked around my neighborhood.\n\nNurse: That sounds lovely. Walking in your neighborhood can be a great way to enjoy the outdoors and stay active. It's a goal worth looking forward to. Now, let's move on to some logistics. Is it okay if we review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Perfect, thank you. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Right knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
