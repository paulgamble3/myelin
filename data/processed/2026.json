    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, I'm glad to hear that. I'm here to make this process as smooth as possible for you. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol, Celebrex, and Atorvastatin. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I am not.\n\nNurse: That's good to know. It's important to avoid certain medications like blood thinners before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
