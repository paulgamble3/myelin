    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol, Celebrex, and Atorvastatin. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I am not.\n\nNurse: That's good to know. It's important to avoid certain medications like blood thinners before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to have that on hand for after the procedure. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss regarding this topic?\n\nPatient: No. Not regarding my medications.",

        "gpt4": "Okay, great! Let's discuss a crucial part of your preoperative preparation - the skin cleaning process. Have you purchased the chlorhexidine scrub for preparing your skin for surgery? This process helps reduce the chance of infection. You can find the scrub at most pharmacies over the counter if you don't have it yet.",
