    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I am not.\n\nNurse: That's good to know. It's important to avoid certain medications like blood thinners before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to have that on hand for after the procedure. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss regarding this topic?\n\nPatient: No. Not regarding my medications.\n\nNurse: Alright, I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "That's fantastic. Now, let's go over how to use the chlorhexidine scrub. You need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. After taking a normal shower and turning the water off, can you do that?",
