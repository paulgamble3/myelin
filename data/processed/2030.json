    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to have that on hand for after the procedure. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss regarding this topic?\n\nPatient: No. Not regarding my medications.\n\nNurse: Alright, I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, you're well-prepared. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect. After taking a normal shower, you'll turn the water off and apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth. You'll then gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great. After applying the scrub, you need to rub it gently into your skin for 5 minutes, then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I understand that's quite a bit of information, do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?",
        "our_model": "Great. Finally, you'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?"
