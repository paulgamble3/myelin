    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a very important question. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve the pain in your knee caused by damage to the joint. Most people experience significant pain relief and improved mobility after recovery. However, it's important to remember that recovery can take time and physical therapy is a crucial part of that process. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: So\n\nNurse: Yes, I'm here to help.\n\nPatient: I will be able to move around a little bit after the surgery, but I'll still have the pain for a few weeks.\n\nNurse: Yes, that's correct. After the surgery, you'll be able to move around a bit, but you'll likely still have some pain. This pain is usually managed with medication. However, the amount of pain and the time it takes to recover can vary from person to person. It's critical to follow your doctor's instructions and participate in physical therapy to help manage your pain and improve your recovery. Is there anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: Nope. Not at this juncture.\n\nNurse: Alright, I'm glad I could answer your questions. Now, I have a couple more questions for you. Firstly, do you currently have any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.",
