    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, that's correct. After the surgery, you'll be able to move around a bit, but you'll likely still have some pain. This pain is usually managed with medication. However, the amount of pain and the time it takes to recover can vary from person to person. It's critical to follow your doctor's instructions and participate in physical therapy to help manage your pain and improve your recovery. Is there anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: Nope. Not at this juncture.\n\nNurse: Alright, I'm glad I could answer your questions. Now, I have a couple more questions for you. Firstly, do you currently have any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, that's what we have on record as well. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]",
