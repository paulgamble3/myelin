    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm here to help. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any other questions you have, feel free to ask.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, I believe we've covered all the necessary topics for today. Before we wrap up, do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, I'm glad we could address all your concerns today. To summarize, before your procedure, remember to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Don't eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. After your procedure, you'll need to follow your doctor's instructions and participate in physical therapy to help manage your pain and improve your recovery. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
