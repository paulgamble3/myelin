    "prompt": "Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Paxton Winner?\n\nPatient: Yes. Oh, so good to hear from you. Yes. I have so many questions, and I'm so cared. Oh, gosh. And, like, you know, I tried to call hospital. They never picked up. So just have so many questions.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear from you. I'm here to help answer all your questions and make sure you're prepared for your upcoming procedure. Before we dive in, may I ask how your day is going so far?\n\nPatient: My day. I don't know. Just preparing for this a nightmare of a procedure\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed before a procedure. I'm here to help make this process as smooth as possible for you. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you today?\n\nPatient: I just have so much pain. And do you think I'll be able to move around without pain after the surgery?\n\nNurse: I can imagine how challenging dealing with constant pain can be. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve the pain in your knee caused by damage to the joint. After recovery, most patients experience significant pain relief and improved mobility. It's important to remember that everyone's recovery process is unique, and it may take some time to see the full benefits. But rest assured, you're in the hands of a very experienced surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens. She's performed over 1000 total knee replacements. With her expertise and your commitment to recovery, we're hopeful for a positive outcome. Speaking of which, have you thought about what you'd like to do once your knee is feeling better?\n\nPatient: Oh, gosh. Yeah. I just really want to be active and just walk without paying",

        "gpt4": "That sounds like a great goal, Paxton. Many patients who have had total knee replacements are able to resume walking without pain, and even engage in low-impact activities. This procedure aims to increase the quality of life and it's great you're looking forward to being more active. \n\nWhile I'm here, how are you feeling about your upcoming procedure? Any thoughts or concerns you'd like to discuss?",
