    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed before a procedure. I'm here to help make this process as smooth as possible for you. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you today?\n\nPatient: I just have so much pain. And do you think I'll be able to move around without pain after the surgery?\n\nNurse: I can imagine how challenging dealing with constant pain can be. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve the pain in your knee caused by damage to the joint. After recovery, most patients experience significant pain relief and improved mobility. It's important to remember that everyone's recovery process is unique, and it may take some time to see the full benefits. But rest assured, you're in the hands of a very experienced surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens. She's performed over 1000 total knee replacements. With her expertise and your commitment to recovery, we're hopeful for a positive outcome. Speaking of which, have you thought about what you'd like to do once your knee is feeling better?\n\nPatient: Oh, gosh. Yeah. I just really want to be active and just walk without paying\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Walking without pain is a significant improvement and it's achievable. It's great to hear that you're looking forward to being more active. How are you feeling about the procedure itself?\n\nPatient: I'm scared.\n\nNurse: It's completely normal to feel scared before a procedure. Rest assured, you're in good hands. Your surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, is highly experienced and has a great track record. The hospital staff is also dedicated to ensuring your comfort and safety. Before we move on, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. But I like what you said. Thank you.",
