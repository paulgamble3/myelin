        "gpt4": "Thank you for sharing that. Aspirin is typically a medication that needs to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor has recommended otherwise. You mentioned that you are currently taking Aspirin. You should have been instructed to stop taking Aspirin 7 days before the procedure, which means you should have already stopped. Did you stop taking Aspirin as instructed?",
        "our_model": "Thank you for sharing that. It's critical to note that medications like Aspirin typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I would advise you to discuss this with your doctor. Now, I notice you've also been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?"
