    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem straightforward to you. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes, please. Sure.\n\nNurse: I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance, Hydrochlorothiazide, Atorvastatin, and Ozempic. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: I actually been taking aspirin. Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's critical to note that medications like Aspirin typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I would advise you to discuss this with your doctor. Now, I notice you've also been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.",
