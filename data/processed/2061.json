    "prompt": "Nurse: I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance, Hydrochlorothiazide, Atorvastatin, and Ozempic. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: I actually been taking aspirin. Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's critical to note that medications like Aspirin typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I would advise you to discuss this with your doctor. Now, I notice you've also been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's important to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What's the difference between Tylenol and s? Friends.",

        "gpt4": "Tylenol and Celebrex are both pain relievers, but they work in different ways. Tylenol, also known as Acetaminophen, works by reducing the amount of a certain chemical in the body that causes pain. Celebrex, on the other hand, is a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or NSAID. It reduces pain and inflammation by blocking the production of certain natural substances in your body. Did this clarify it for you?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question. Tylenol, also known as acetaminophen, is a pain reliever that can help with mild to moderate pain. Celebrex, on the other hand, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help reduce pain and inflammation. Both can be used to manage pain, but they work differently and are often used together to provide more effective pain relief. Does that help clarify things for you?"
