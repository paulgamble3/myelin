    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's critical to note that medications like Aspirin typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I would advise you to discuss this with your doctor. Now, I notice you've also been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's important to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What's the difference between Tylenol and s? Friends.\n\nNurse: That's a great question. Tylenol, also known as acetaminophen, is a pain reliever that can help with mild to moderate pain. Celebrex, on the other hand, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help reduce pain and inflammation. Both can be used to manage pain, but they work differently and are often used together to provide more effective pain relief. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: So I can take both your saying?\n\nNurse: Yes, you can take both. They can be used together to manage your pain more effectively. However, it's important to follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist regarding the dosage and timing of these medications. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Well, I mean, all this medications, I just, like, so scared taking them. It's so much. You know?",

        "gpt4": "I hear your concerns. It might feel overwhelming having to take multiple medications, but each one has a critical role in your recovery process. While Tylenol and Celebrex are for managing pain, your other medications are for your ongoing conditions. It's important to continue taking them as prescribed even as you prepare for your surgery. If you feel anxious about handling all these medications, do you think it might help to write out a schedule or create reminders on your phone? Also, it's okay to ask for help from a loved one.",
        "our_model": "I can understand why you might feel that way. It's a lot to manage. However, these medications are an important part of your recovery process. They help manage your pain and inflammation, which is crucial for your healing. Remember, your doctor has prescribed these medications because they believe they are necessary for your recovery. If you have any concerns or if the medications make you feel uncomfortable, it's important to discuss this with your doctor. Would you like to discuss anything else about your medications?"
