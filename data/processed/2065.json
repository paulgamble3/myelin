Celebrex, on the other hand, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help reduce pain and inflammation. Both can be used to manage pain, but they work differently and are often used together to provide more effective pain relief. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: So I can take both your saying?\n\nNurse: Yes, you can take both. They can be used together to manage your pain more effectively.
