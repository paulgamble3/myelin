    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course. Aleve, also known as naproxen, is a type of medication called a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It's used to reduce pain, inflammation, and fever. It's typically taken as needed for pain, but it's important to follow the instructions on the label or from your doctor. If you have any specific questions about Aleve or how to take it, I'm here to help.\n\nPatient: Alright.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could provide some information about Aleve. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery.\n\nPatient: Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery. This is an important step to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: I actually did pick it up. Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: It's",

        "gpt4": "Great. After you turn off the water, apply the scrub with your hands to your entire body from neck down. Pay special attention to the area where your surgery will be. Lather and gently scrub your skin for 5 minutes. Do not rush this process. Then rinse thoroughly with warm water. Do not wash with your regular soap after you have used the scrub. Don't apply any lotion, cream, deodorant, or powder after using the scrub. Does that make sense, or would you like me to repeat any of the steps?",
