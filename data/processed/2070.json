        "gpt4": "The chlorhexidine scrub is a special antiseptic cleanser that helps reduce the risk of infection by getting rid of any potentially harmful bacteria on your skin. After you take a shower and turn the water off, you should apply the scrub to your entire body from the neck down. Make sure to pay special attention to the area where you're having surgery. But don't use the scrub on your face or genital area. After applying, let it sit on your skin for a few minutes, and then rinse it off thoroughly. Does that make sense?",

You'll apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's important to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?"
