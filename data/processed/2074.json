    "prompt": "Nurse: The chlorhexidine scrub is an antiseptic that helps reduce the number of germs on your skin. It's used to clean your skin before surgery to help prevent infection. You'll apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's important to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Why no face?\n\nNurse: It's recommended to avoid using the scrub on your face because it can cause irritation, especially around the eyes. The same goes for the crotch area and hair, as these areas can be more sensitive to the scrub. After you've applied the scrub, you'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes. That makes sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any other questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: Not about the scrub. No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes. Ten at night. Correct? Twice, you said?",

        "gpt4": "Yes, that's correct. You need to use the scrub twice - once the night before your procedure and again the morning of your procedure. This helps to ensure your skin is as clean as possible to reduce the chance of infection. Does that answer your question?",
        "our_model": "Yes, that's correct. You'll need to use the scrub twice - once the night before your procedure and again the morning of your procedure. It's an important step to help reduce the risk of infection. Now, let's discuss the next part of your preparation, which is when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?"
