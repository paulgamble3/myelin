    "prompt": "Patient: So\n\nPatient: Can I have some water\n\nNurse: On the day of your procedure, you can have small sips of water up to 2 hours before your procedure. However, it's important not to have any food or drinks other than water during this time. This is to ensure your stomach is empty for the anesthesia. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: I'm here to help. If you have any other questions or concerns about when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure, please feel free to ask.\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad that's clear. Now, I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a few more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Will I be able to move around freely?",

        "gpt4": "After a total knee replacement, most patients experience improved mobility and less pain compared to before their surgery. However, the recovery period varies for everyone. It typically involves a period of physical therapy to regain strength and mobility in your knee. During the recovery period, it's generally recommended to limit activities that might stress your knee, like heavy lifting or high-impact exercise. Your healthcare team will provide specific guidance on what you can and can't do during your recovery. Does this help address your question?",
