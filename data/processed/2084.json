        "our_model": "Yes, your procedure is scheduled for August 13th, which is two days from today. It's normal to feel a bit nervous before a procedure, but remember, you're in good hands with Doctor Stevens and the team at O'Connor Hospital. Before your procedure, remember to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure, and to stop eating and drinking after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?"
