    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Aguirre, your response got cut off. Could you please repeat your blood pressure reading from this morning?\n\nPatient: Eight.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Aguirre. A blood pressure reading of 128/80 is slightly elevated. Would it be okay if I share some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: I don't know where you've got that number. That not what I said.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please repeat your blood pressure reading from this morning?\n\nPatient: One eighteen over seventy eight.\n\nNurse: Thank you for clarifying that, Ms. Aguirre. A blood pressure reading of 118/78 is within the normal range. That's great news. It's critical to keep monitoring it regularly. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: Well, were they normal or abnormal?",

        "gpt4": "I appreciate you asking, Ms. Aguirre. Most of your results were within the normal range. Your sodium (Na) level was 137 mEq/L, which is normal. Your potassium (K) level was 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level, which measures how well your kidneys are working, was 6.17 mmol/L, slightly below the usual range.\n\nYour creatinine level, another measure of kidney function, was slightly elevated at 2.0 mg/dL. Your Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), which estimates how well your kidneys filter waste, was 28 mL/min/1.73m2, indicating that your kidneys aren't functioning at their best - which aligns with your diagnosis of Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease.\n\nLastly, your urine albumin level, which measures the amount of a protein called albumin in your urine, was 65 mg/g. Elevated urine albumin can indicate kidney damage.\n\nI've just given you a lot of information. Can I clarify anything further for you?",
        "our_model": "Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is 6.17 mmol/L, and your creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL, both of which are within normal limits. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 28 mL/min/1.73m2, and your Urine Albumin is 65 mg/g. These last two values are a bit higher than normal, which is something your doctor may want to monitor. Does this help clarify your lab results, Ms. Aguirre?"
