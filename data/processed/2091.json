I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Jami Wyatt, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately?\n\nPatient: I've been alright. Thanks.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week?\n\nPatient: I'm going to the dock. Park with my dogs, so that'll be fun.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful time! What kind of dogs do you have, and what's your favorite part about spending time with them at the park?\n\nPatient: Well, I have six poodles. They're all show dogs. And this is their one time a month. They get to go to the park and be real dogs.",
