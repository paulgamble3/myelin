    "prompt": "Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful time! What kind of dogs do you have, and what's your favorite part about spending time with them at the park?\n\nPatient: Well, I have six poodles. They're all show dogs. And this is their one time a month. They get to go to the park and be real dogs.\n\nNurse: Six poodles, that's quite a pack! It must be a joy to see them let loose and enjoy being \"real dogs\" at the park. Do they have a favorite activity or spot at the park?\n\nPatient: I think they mostly just like to run around some of them like to play fetch.\n\nNurse: It's great that they get to enjoy some free time and play fetch. Before we move on, is there anything you've been feeling concerned about health-wise that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
