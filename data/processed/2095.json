    "prompt": "Nurse: Six poodles, that's quite a pack! It must be a joy to see them let loose and enjoy being \"real dogs\" at the park. Do they have a favorite activity or spot at the park?\n\nPatient: I think they mostly just like to run around some of them like to play fetch.\n\nNurse: It's great that they get to enjoy some free time and play fetch. Before we move on, is there anything you've been feeling concerned about health-wise that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
