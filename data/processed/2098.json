    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Could you share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: One twelve.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. A blood sugar level of 120 is a bit higher than the target range. Would it be alright if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: My level is less than one twenty though.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion. A blood sugar level of 120 is indeed within the target range for people with diabetes. That's a good reading. Let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was?\n\nPatient: I didn't say one twenty. I said my measurement was one hundred and twelve.",
