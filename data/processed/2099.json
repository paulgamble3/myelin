    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. Could you share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: One twelve.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. A blood sugar level of 120 is a bit higher than the target range. Would it be alright if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: My level is less than one twenty though.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion. A blood sugar level of 120 is indeed within the target range for people with diabetes. That's a good reading. Let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was?\n\nPatient: I didn't say one twenty. I said my measurement was one hundred and twelve.\n\nNurse: I apologize for misunderstanding. A blood pressure reading of 112 is within the normal range, which is good news. It's critical to keep monitoring it regularly. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: No. No. No. No. No. My blood sugar level was one twelve.",
