    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Aguirre. A blood pressure reading of 128/80 is slightly elevated. Would it be okay if I share some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: I don't know where you've got that number. That not what I said.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please repeat your blood pressure reading from this morning?\n\nPatient: One eighteen over seventy eight.\n\nNurse: Thank you for clarifying that, Ms. Aguirre. A blood pressure reading of 118/78 is within the normal range. That's great news. It's critical to keep monitoring it regularly. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: Well, were they normal or abnormal?\n\nNurse: Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is 6.17 mmol/L, and your creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL, both of which are within normal limits. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 28 mL/min/1.73m2, and your Urine Albumin is 65 mg/g. These last two values are a bit higher than normal, which is something your doctor may want to monitor. Does this help clarify your lab results, Ms. Aguirre?\n\nPatient: Okay.",

        "our_model": "is 28 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are not filtering your blood as well as they should be, as this is lower than the normal range. Your urine albumin level is 65 mg/g, which is higher than normal. This could indicate some kidney damage. I hope this information is helpful, Ms. Aguirre. Do you have any questions about these results?"
