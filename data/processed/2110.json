    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. Taking your medication as prescribed is crucial for managing your conditions. It's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Remember, there are medications and supplements that aren't safe for CKD patients to take. You should talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over the counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm on the dash diet now. I'm trying to be healthier, so I'm eating a lot of salad, including the Wishbone Italian salad dress thing. Speaking of which can you tell me how much salt is in this dressing?\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear you're making healthier choices. As for the Wishbone Italian dressing, I don't have the exact sodium content at the moment. However, most salad dressings can be high in sodium. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label on the bottle. Would you like me to provide some general tips for managing your sodium intake?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great! \n\nFirstly, try to cook at home more often. You have more control over the ingredients and can limit the amount of salt used. \n\nChoose fresh, unprocessed foods as they tend to have less sodium.\n\nWhen buying canned or frozen foods, look for \"no salt added\" or \"low sodium\" labels.\n\nLastly, train your palate to enjoy foods with less salt. This can take some time, but the health benefits are well worth it. And you'll start to appreciate the natural flavours of foods more.\n\nRemember to maintain a balanced diet including fruits and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains and healthy fats. And, of course, keep up with drinking plenty of water. Are you okay if we move on to discussing your other conditions now?",
        "our_model": "Okay. One way to manage your sodium intake is to choose fresh foods over processed ones whenever possible. This includes fresh fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains. When you do use packaged foods, check the sodium content on the nutrition label. Also, try to limit your use of salt in cooking and at the table. Instead, you can use herbs and spices to add flavor to your meals. Lastly, when eating out, ask for your meal to be prepared without added salt. Does this sound manageable to you?"
