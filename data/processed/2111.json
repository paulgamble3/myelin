    "prompt": "Nurse: That's excellent. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Remember, there are medications and supplements that aren't safe for CKD patients to take. You should talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over the counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm on the dash diet now. I'm trying to be healthier, so I'm eating a lot of salad, including the Wishbone Italian salad dress thing. Speaking of which can you tell me how much salt is in this dressing?\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear you're making healthier choices. As for the Wishbone Italian dressing, I don't have the exact sodium content at the moment. However, most salad dressings can be high in sodium. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label on the bottle. Would you like me to provide some general tips for managing your sodium intake?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay. One way to manage your sodium intake is to choose fresh foods over processed ones whenever possible. This includes fresh fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains. When you do use packaged foods, check the sodium content on the nutrition label. Also, try to limit your use of salt in cooking and at the table. Instead, you can use herbs and spices to add flavor to your meals. Lastly, when eating out, ask for your meal to be prepared without added salt. Does this sound manageable to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
