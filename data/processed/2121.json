    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand. Quitting smoking is a personal decision and it's important to do it when you're ready. Can you share why you're not ready to quit at this time?\n\nPatient: I just don't see the need in it. I really like it for stress, especially now that I'm not, you know, drinking.\n\nNurse: I understand that smoking can be a way to cope with stress. However, it's important to remember that it can also have negative effects on your health, especially with your existing conditions. If you ever decide you're ready to quit, there are many resources available to help. Would you like me to share some of these resources with you?\n\nPatient: Not right now.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. Remember, if you ever change your mind, there are many resources available to help you quit smoking. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Can we talk about my lab?\n\nNurse: Of course. Could you specify which lab results you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: What does GFR mean and how is it measured?",

        "gpt4": "GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working by determining the rate at which your kidneys filter blood. It's calculated using a formula that considers variables including your age, race, gender, and your blood creatinine level. A GFR result of 60 or higher is in the normal range. Your recent tests show a GFR of 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates some decline in kidney function. It's important to have regular check-ups to monitor this. Does this help clarify things?",
        "our_model": "GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. A GFR below 60 for three months or more may mean kidney disease. Your GFR is 43, which indicates some kidney damage. It's important to continue managing your health conditions to protect your kidney function. Does this help clarify what GFR is?"
