It's completely normal to have some worries about upcoming medical procedures. How are you feeling about your colonoscopy procedure?\n\nPatient: Well, I know it's not gonna be pleasant. But it should be over pretty quickly. And then hopefully, will have an answer as to why I've been having my my issues.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. It's quite a process to go through this procedure, but it's great that you're hoping for some answers to your unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. Before we begin, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy for unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. We hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: You certainly may do that. Yes.",
