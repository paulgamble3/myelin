    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're having a good day, Mr. Valenzuela. It's completely normal to have some worries about upcoming medical procedures. How are you feeling about your colonoscopy procedure?\n\nPatient: Well, I know it's not gonna be pleasant. But it should be over pretty quickly. And then hopefully, will have an answer as to why I've been having my my issues.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. It's quite a process to go through this procedure, but it's great that you're hoping for some answers to your unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. Before we begin, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy for unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. We hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: You certainly may do that. Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We will also have another call the day before your procedure. Let's start with the first item on our checklist. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: I could use a refresh.",
    "responses": {
        "gpt4": "Certainly, Mr. Valenzuela. I'll note down that you would like a refreshment on the dietary restrictions and have your care team get back to you with the specifics. \n\nNow, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Dr. Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Does this timing work for you?",
        "our_model": "Of course, Mr. Valenzuela. The day before your colonoscopy, you should only consume clear liquids. This includes broths, clear juices, tea, coffee without milk, and clear soft drinks. You should avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. On the day of your colonoscopy, you should not eat or drink anything, except for necessary medications with a sip of water, until after your procedure. Does that help clarify the dietary restrictions?"
