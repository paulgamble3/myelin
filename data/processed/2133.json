    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. It's quite a process to go through this procedure, but it's great that you're hoping for some answers to your unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. Before we begin, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy for unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. We hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: You certainly may do that. Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We will also have another call the day before your procedure. Let's start with the first item on our checklist. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: I could use a refresh.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Valenzuela. The day before your colonoscopy, you should only consume clear liquids. This includes broths, clear juices, tea, coffee without milk, and clear soft drinks. You should avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. On the day of your colonoscopy, you should not eat or drink anything, except for necessary medications with a sip of water, until after your procedure. Does that help clarify the dietary restrictions?\n\nPatient: I believe it does.",
