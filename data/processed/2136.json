    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, Mr. Valenzuela. The day before your colonoscopy, you should only consume clear liquids. This includes broths, clear juices, tea, coffee without milk, and clear soft drinks. You should avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. On the day of your colonoscopy, you should not eat or drink anything, except for necessary medications with a sip of water, until after your procedure. Does that help clarify the dietary restrictions?\n\nPatient: I believe it does.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine with me.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: First floor of O'Connor. Yes. It's fine.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.",

        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?"
