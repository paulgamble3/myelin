    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine with me.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: First floor of O'Connor. Yes. It's fine.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: We can move on.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Valenzuela. Let's talk about your medications. According to your medical chart, there has been no change in your medication prior to the procedure. However, it's crucial to note a few things. Are you taking any medications such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or any other blood thinners? These usually need to be stopped before a colonoscopy.",
        "our_model": "Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?"
