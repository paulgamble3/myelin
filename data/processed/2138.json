    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: First floor of O'Connor. Yes. It's fine.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: We can move on.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I don't take any of those things.",

        "gpt4": "Okay, Mr. Valenzuela. That's good to hear. Those types of medicines usually need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about your current medications or any medication protocol associated with this procedure?",
        "our_model": "That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's essential to avoid those medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor before a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss in this regard?"
