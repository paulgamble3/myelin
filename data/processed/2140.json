    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: We can move on.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I don't take any of those things.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's essential to avoid those medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor before a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss in this regard?\n\nPatient: Know nothing else I can think of, but I think you're the one who has all the information.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your trust, Mr. Valenzuela. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice. You should avoid high fiber foods like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Does that make sense to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Low fiber is what we're doing now.",

        "gpt4": "Exactly, Mr. Valenzuela. It's a bit different from the usual advice of eating lots of fruits and veggies. Are there any questions you have about what type of food you can and cannot eat during this time?",
        "our_model": "Yes, exactly, Mr. Valenzuela. Low fiber foods are easier for your body to digest and will help prepare you for your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?"
