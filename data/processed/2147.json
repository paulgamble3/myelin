    "prompt": "Nurse: Ice cream is a popular choice, Mr. Valenzuela. It's a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Just remember to avoid any fruit toppings that are high in fiber. Do you have any other favorite low fiber comfort foods?\n\nPatient: No. I think I'm an ice cream person.\n\nNurse: Ice cream sounds like a great choice, Mr. Valenzuela. Just remember to enjoy it in moderation. Now, let's move on to the next topic. You will also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I don't take those.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to avoid those supplements and medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss in this regard?\n\nPatient: Nothing else.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I've heard it's not pleasant. But it's something that I will only have to do once, hopefully, and I'd have to do it again very soon.",

        "gpt4": "You're right, Mr. Valenzuela. Many patients find the preparation for the colonoscopy, especially the clear liquid diet and usage of the PLENVU laxative solution, to be a bit challenging. However, they also mention that the procedure itself is usually no problem at all. Let's try to make this as comfortable as we can for you. I see that you have a strong attitude about it, which could be very helpful during this process. Is there anything specific about the diet or the laxative that you're wondering about?",
        "our_model": "You're absolutely right, Mr. Valenzuela. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. However, we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?"
