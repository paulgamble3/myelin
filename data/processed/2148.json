    "prompt": "Nurse: Ice cream sounds like a great choice, Mr. Valenzuela. Just remember to enjoy it in moderation. Now, let's move on to the next topic. You will also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I don't take those.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to avoid those supplements and medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss in this regard?\n\nPatient: Nothing else.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I've heard it's not pleasant. But it's something that I will only have to do once, hopefully, and I'd have to do it again very soon.\n\nNurse: You're absolutely right, Mr. Valenzuela. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. However, we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Not really.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Just remember, you don't have to start this just yet. You'll need to begin your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I provide you with some examples of what clear liquids are? You can ask any questions you have about this diet.",
