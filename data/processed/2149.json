    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to avoid those supplements and medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss in this regard?\n\nPatient: Nothing else.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I've heard it's not pleasant. But it's something that I will only have to do once, hopefully, and I'd have to do it again very soon.\n\nNurse: You're absolutely right, Mr. Valenzuela. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. However, we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Not really.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Just to remind you, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Oh, please do.",

        "gpt4": "Of course, Mr. Valenzuela. Clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks like Gatorade or Powerade, popsicles, and jello or other gelatin as long as they're without fruit or red color.\n\nYou should also avoid dairy, alcohol, and any red or purple colored beverages. It's important that the liquids you consume are clear, not necessarily colorless. For example, you can have apple juice or lemon-lime soda, but not orange juice or milk. \n\nDo you have any questions about the clear liquid diet or is there anything else you'd like me to clarify?",
