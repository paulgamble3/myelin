    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I've heard it's not pleasant. But it's something that I will only have to do once, hopefully, and I'd have to do it again very soon.\n\nNurse: You're absolutely right, Mr. Valenzuela. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. However, we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Not really.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Just to remind you, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Oh, please do.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Valenzuela. Clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's critical to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No questions.",

        "gpt4": "That's great to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. You seem well-prepared for this part of your prep. Now, let's discuss the other essential step in your preparation: the bowel prep using the PLENVU laxative solution. You'll need to begin drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6 PM the night before the procedure. Then, you'll wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Does this align with the instructions you received, or would you like me to clarify anything for you?",
