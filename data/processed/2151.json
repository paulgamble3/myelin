    "prompt": "Nurse: You're absolutely right, Mr. Valenzuela. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. However, we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Not really.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Just to remind you, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Oh, please do.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Valenzuela. Clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's critical to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the clear liquid diet. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. I think I can just chug it. But I should be drinking it the morning of the procedure. So right before the procedure.",

It's crucial to complete this step to ensure your colon is entirely clean for the procedure. It's also important to remember to stop drinking the solution and all other liquids four hours before your procedure. Do you have any remaining questions about the PLENVU solution or the bowel prep?",
