    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, Mr. Valenzuela. Clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's critical to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the clear liquid diet. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. I think I can just chug it. But I should be drinking it the morning of the procedure. So right before the procedure.\n\nNurse: That's correct, Mr. Valenzuela. You'll finish the second half of the solution the morning of your procedure. It's great to hear that you're feeling confident about drinking the solution. Just remember, it's important to drink plenty of clear liquids along with the solution to stay hydrated. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the bowel prep. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss in this regard?\n\nPatient: No. I don't have any questions about that.",
