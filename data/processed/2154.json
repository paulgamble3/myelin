    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the clear liquid diet. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. I think I can just chug it. But I should be drinking it the morning of the procedure. So right before the procedure.\n\nNurse: That's correct, Mr. Valenzuela. You'll finish the second half of the solution the morning of your procedure. It's great to hear that you're feeling confident about drinking the solution. Just remember, it's important to drink plenty of clear liquids along with the solution to stay hydrated. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the bowel prep. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss in this regard?\n\nPatient: No. I don't have any questions about that.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you understand when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. Now, I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have 2 more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I think you've been pretty clear about it all.",
