Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the bowel prep. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss in this regard?\n\nPatient: No. I don't have any questions about that.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you understand when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. Now, I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have 2 more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I think you've been pretty clear about it all.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela.
