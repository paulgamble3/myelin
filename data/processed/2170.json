Is there anything specific that's causing you stress today?\n\nPatient: I'm just scared for this procedure. So\n\nNurse: I can see why you might be feeling scared. It's a big procedure, but it's also a very common one with a high success rate. Doctor Cristina Stevens, your surgeon, is highly experienced and has performed over 1000 total knee replacements. She's known for her excellent work. Is there anything you're looking forward to once you've recovered from your knee replacement?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm I'm hoping a bit better in time to go to Maya.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful plan.\n\nPatient: My grandson's birthday party.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal.\n\nPatient: You think I'll be pain free. By then, it's about about a week after the surgery.",

It's important to remember that everyone's recovery timeline is different, especially when it comes to a procedure like a total knee replacement. However, it's great that you're motivated by your grandson's birthday. It's always a joy to spend time with loved ones. How are you feeling about the procedure itself?"
