Is there anything you're looking forward to once you've recovered from your knee replacement?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm I'm hoping a bit better in time to go to Maya.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful plan.\n\nPatient: My grandson's birthday party.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal.\n\nPatient: You think I'll be pain free. By then, it's about about a week after the surgery.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. It's important to remember that everyone's recovery timeline is different, especially when it comes to a procedure like a total knee replacement. However, it's great that you're motivated by your grandson's birthday. It's always a joy to spend time with loved ones. How are you feeling about the procedure itself?\n\nPatient: I'm scared. I'm, yeah, I'm not looking forward to it.",
