It's important to remember that everyone's recovery timeline is different, especially when it comes to a procedure like a total knee replacement. However, it's great that you're motivated by your grandson's birthday. It's always a joy to spend time with loved ones. How are you feeling about the procedure itself?\n\nPatient: I'm scared. I'm, yeah, I'm not looking forward to it.\n\nNurse: I can see why you might feel that way. It's a big step, but it's also a step towards reducing the pain you've been experiencing and improving your mobility. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: Well, I feel like I gotta tell you I tested positive for COVID.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you've tested positive for COVID. I'll make sure to pass this information along to the team at O'Connor Hospital. They will be able to guide you on the next steps, including any necessary adjustments to your surgery date. Is there anything else you're worried about regarding your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
