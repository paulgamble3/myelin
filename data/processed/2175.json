    "prompt": "Nurse: I can see why you might feel that way. It's a big step, but it's also a step towards reducing the pain you've been experiencing and improving your mobility. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: Well, I feel like I gotta tell you I tested positive for COVID.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you've tested positive for COVID. I'll make sure to pass this information along to the team at O'Connor Hospital. They will be able to guide you on the next steps, including any necessary adjustments to your surgery date. Is there anything else you're worried about regarding your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine.",
