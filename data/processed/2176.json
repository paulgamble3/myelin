They will be able to guide you on the next steps, including any necessary adjustments to your surgery date. Is there anything else you're worried about regarding your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
