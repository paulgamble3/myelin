    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications, but I want to make sure you're ready. Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Lantus, 5 units once a day. For the day of the procedure, you'll need to adjust this to 2 units of Lantus. Have you already made this adjustment, or is this something you'll need to do in the coming days?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I'll do it.\n\nNurse: Great. It's important to make this adjustment for the day of the procedure. Do you have any questions about this change?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: Alright. Nope.",
