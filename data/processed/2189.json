    "prompt": "Nurse: I see.\n\nPatient: Tylenol.\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion. You're currently prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yeah. But I'm already taking care now. Do I need the stop it before my surgery or no?\n\nNurse: You can continue taking your Tylenol as prescribed. It's safe to use before your surgery. Do you have any other questions about your medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's discuss how to prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
