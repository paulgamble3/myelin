    "prompt": "Nurse: You can continue taking your Tylenol as prescribed. It's safe to use before your surgery. Do you have any other questions about your medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's discuss how to prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. Remember to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
