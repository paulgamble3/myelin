    "prompt": "Nurse: I can imagine that it's a bit nerve-wracking. It's completely normal to feel this way. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any specific concerns or questions you'd like to discuss before we go over the details of your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. If you have any questions at any point during our conversation, feel free to ask. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained abdominal pain. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Like I said before, I'm feeling a little bit anxious.\n\nNurse: I can see why you might feel that way. It's a big step, but it's also an important one in finding out what's causing your discomfort. We hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. Would it be alright if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll also have another call the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our list. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions leading up to your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes. I am.",
