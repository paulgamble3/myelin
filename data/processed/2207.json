Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Okay. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Plavix 75 mg once a day. For your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking Plavix 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 8th, which is 2 days from today. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. Do you have any questions about Plavix or the instructions to stop it?\n\nPatient: No.",
