    "prompt": "Patient: Multigram toast.\n\nPatient: With cream cheese.\n\nNurse: Multigrain toast with cream cheese sounds delicious. It's a good choice for your low fiber diet. Do you usually have it for breakfast or as a snack?\n\nPatient: Ass of math sometimes.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat when you usually have your multigrain toast with cream cheese?\n\nPatient: During breakfast?\n\nNurse: That sounds like a great way to start the day. It's a good choice for your low fiber diet. Now, let's move on to the next topic. You'll also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.",

        "gpt4": "Great, that does make the preparation a bit easier. Now, as for the day before the procedure, you'll need to be on a clear liquid diet. This includes items like broths, teas, clear juices, jello, and popsicles without pulp or seeds. It might be a little bit of a challenge, but it's important to prepare your bowel for the procedure. I want to check in with you - how are you feeling so far? Any questions about the diet or medications?",
        "our_model": "That's good to hear. These supplements can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any questions about this or any other aspect of your preparation?"
