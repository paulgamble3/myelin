Could you please repeat when you usually have your multigrain toast with cream cheese?\n\nPatient: During breakfast?\n\nNurse: That sounds like a great way to start the day. It's a good choice for your low fiber diet. Now, let's move on to the next topic. You'll also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications.

Do you have any questions about this or any other aspect of your preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",
