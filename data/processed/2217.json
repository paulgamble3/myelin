    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat when you usually have your multigrain toast with cream cheese?\n\nPatient: During breakfast?\n\nNurse: That sounds like a great way to start the day. It's a good choice for your low fiber diet. Now, let's move on to the next topic. You'll also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. These supplements can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any questions about this or any other aspect of your preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling good.",

        "gpt4": "That's encouraging to hear. Most people find the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel preparation can be quite an adjustment. Let's get into the details, and as always, tell me if you have any questions. You don't need to start this part just yet, but you'll need to begin your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure. This involves drinking only clear liquids, which means no solid foods and specifically no beverages with any red or purple dye. Can I share a few examples of clear liquids?",
