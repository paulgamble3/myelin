    "prompt": "Nurse: That sounds like a great way to start the day. It's a good choice for your low fiber diet. Now, let's move on to the next topic. You'll also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. These supplements can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any questions about this or any other aspect of your preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling good about it. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about the clear liquid diet or the GoLYTELY laxative solution?\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]",

        "gpt4": "To keep our conversation going, the first thing you should know is that you don't have to start your clear liquid diet just yet. But you'll need to start it 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids and not eating any solid foods. This means you can drink clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Does this make sense so far?",
        "our_model": "That's perfectly fine."
