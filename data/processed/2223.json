    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: It's okay. I got it. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. I got it. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: Nope.",

This includes not eating or drinking anything, not even water, on the morning of your procedure. Do you have any questions about when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure?",
