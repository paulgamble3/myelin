I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions about anything we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. My next question is about your current health status. Have you noticed any signs of illness recently, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.",
