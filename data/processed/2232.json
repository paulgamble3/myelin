    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. It's critical to have someone available to take you home after the procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the logistics of your procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Of course. What's on your mind?\n\nPatient: I don't have any questions, Rachel. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over your medication, dietary changes, and the bowel prep process. You've also confirmed that you're feeling well and have arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Sounds good.",
