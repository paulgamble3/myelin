As we move forward, I'd like to know how you're feeling about your upcoming colonoscopy procedure. [\n\nPatient: I'm looking forward to getting it over with.\n\nNurse: I can appreciate that sentiment, Mr. Valenzuela. It's quite a process to go through, but it's an important step in addressing your health concerns. Before we begin, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. I see from your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. I hope this procedure provides you and your doctor with the answers you're looking for. Would it be alright if we go over a few topics on preparing for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great. The colonoscopy will allow your doctor to directly view your colon and rectum. The day before the procedure, you will be on a clear-liquid diet, and then you will need to drink a bowel-cleaning substance. This preparation is important as it cleanses your colon so that your doctor can clearly see any abnormalities during the procedure. How do you feel about this preparation process?",
