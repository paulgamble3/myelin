    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to reach out. I'll also call you the day before your procedure to check in. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss at this time?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",
