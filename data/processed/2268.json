    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics are clear. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes, please. Let's move on",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. It appears there's been no change in your medication regimen, which is great. I see no prescribed medications on your chart that you would need to stop taking before your colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask: are you currently taking any over-the-counter meds like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?",
