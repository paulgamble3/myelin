Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics are clear. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes, please. Let's move on\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your medication in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I'd like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.",
