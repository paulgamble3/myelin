    "prompt": "Nurse: Perfect, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics are clear. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes, please. Let's move on\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your medication in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I'd like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's critical to avoid those medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Do you have any questions about your medications or anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to your diet?\n\nPatient: Let's move on to my diet.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect, Mr. Valenzuela. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet in preparation for your colonoscopy. This includes foods such as white bread, pasta, and rice. Avoid high fiber foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?",
        "our_model": "Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you should avoid whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. Instead, you can eat foods like white bread, rice, and pasta, cooked vegetables, and lean proteins like chicken or fish. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?"
