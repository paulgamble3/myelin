    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your medication in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I'd like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's critical to avoid those medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Do you have any questions about your medications or anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to your diet?\n\nPatient: Let's move on to my diet.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you should avoid whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. Instead, you can eat foods like white bread, rice, and pasta, cooked vegetables, and lean proteins like chicken or fish. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: No. No questions at all.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the dietary instructions. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Pasta",
    "responses": {
        "gpt4": "Pasta is a wonderful choice for a low fiber meal, Mr. Valenzuela. You can prepare it with a butter or oil-based sauce instead of a tomato-based one, which may have seeds. Are you planning on making it yourself, or do you have a favorite spot that you'll order from?",
        "our_model": "Pasta is a great choice, Mr. Valenzuela. It's versatile and can be prepared in many ways while still being low in fiber. Do you have a favorite pasta dish that you're looking forward to having during this time?"
