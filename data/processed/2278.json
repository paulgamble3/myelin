    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not a celebratory occasion, but it's a time to take care of your health. It's a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low\n\nPatient: So, yeah, I'm not that excited about it. Okay?\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not a typical situation to be excited about. However, it's a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. It's all part of the preparation for the procedure. Let's move on to discuss supplements. Are you currently taking any supplements like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's essential to avoid those supplements and medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the information about supplements. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm not thrilled.",

        "gpt4": "Not being thrilled is a common response, Mr. Valenzuela. A clear liquid diet and bowel prep can be challenging, but they are necessary steps to ensure a successful colonoscopy. You don't have to do anything just yet. Are you ready to discuss the clear liquid diet?",
        "our_model": "I can understand that, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not an easy part of the process, but it's necessary for the procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?"
