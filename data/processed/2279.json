    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not a typical situation to be excited about. However, it's a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. It's all part of the preparation for the procedure. Let's move on to discuss supplements. Are you currently taking any supplements like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's essential to avoid those supplements and medications unless specifically recommended by your doctor. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the information about supplements. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm not thrilled.\n\nNurse: I can understand that, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not an easy part of the process, but it's necessary for the procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. Right now, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure. This involves drinking only clear liquids and no solid foods. You should also refrain from drinking any beverages with red or purple dye. Does this make sense to you?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I want to remind you that you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?"
