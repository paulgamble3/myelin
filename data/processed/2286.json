    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the dietary instructions. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. Thank you.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Valenzuela. If you change your mind or have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Understand.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. It's essential to follow these instructions closely for the best results. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I appreciate your patience. My next question is about your current health status. Do you have any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.",
