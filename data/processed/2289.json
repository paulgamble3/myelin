Do you have any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to be in good health for your procedure. Now, I'd like to ask if you've arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Have you done so?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Valenzuela. It's critical to have someone to accompany you home after the procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the logistics of your procedure day?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the logistics. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I can't think of any.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad I could help clarify things, Mr. Valenzuela. To summarize, we've discussed your colonoscopy appointment with Dr. Bailey on August 13th at 9:00 AM at O'Connor Hospital; the low fiber diet leading up to the colonoscopy, along with the need to stop taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications; the clear liquid diet and bowel prep the day before the procedure, and the need for a designated driver to take you home afterwards. Does everything we've discussed sound accurate to you?",
        "our_model": "That's perfectly fine, Mr. Valenzuela. If you think of any questions later, don't hesitate to reach out. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over the dietary restrictions, the need to take a bowel prep solution, and the importance of having someone to drive you home after the procedure. You've confirmed that you're clear on all these instructions. Does that sound right to you?"
