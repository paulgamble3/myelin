    "prompt": "Patient: Okay.\n\nNurse: and the importance of having someone to accompany you to the procedure and drive you home afterwards. Does that sound right, Mr. Valenzuela?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that we're on the same page. Remember, I'm here for you every step of the way. I will call you again the day before the procedure to go over step by step all the prep instructions. If you need to reach us in the meantime, you can call us back at 641-381-6523. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Sounds great. Can I ask you a question?\n\nNurse: Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Valenzuela. What's your question?\n\nPatient: What is colorectal cancer and what are the common risk factors for developing it. Rachel, are you there?",

        "gpt4": "Yes, I'm here Mr. Valenzuela. Colorectal cancer is a term for cancer that begins in either the colon or the rectum. It usually starts as a polyp or small growth in the lining of the colon or rectum. Over time, some of these polyps can become cancerous, which is why removing them early (as in a colonoscopy) is so important to prevent the development of cancer.\n\nCommon risk factors for developing colorectal cancer include:\n- Age: The risk increases significantly after age 50, but it can occur at any age.\n- Family history: If your parents, siblings or children had colon or rectal cancer, you are at a higher risk.\n- Diet: Diets high in fat and low in fiber may increase your risk.\n- Certain disorders: People with disorders like Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis have a higher risk.\n- Lifestyle factors: Physical inactivity, obesity, alcohol consumption, and smoking increase your risk.\n\nKeep in mind this is a general overview and each person's risk can depend on multiple factors including genetics, environment, and lifestyle. Regular screening is one of the most powerful ways to lower your risk because doctors can find and remove polyps before they have a chance to turn into",
        "our_model": "Yes, I'm here, Mr. Valenzuela. Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that affects the colon and rectum. Common risk factors include age (over 50), family history of colorectal cancer, personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, certain genetic syndromes, diet high in red and processed meats, smoking, heavy alcohol use, obesity, and lack of regular physical activity. Regular screenings like colonoscopies can help detect colorectal cancer in the earliest stages, reduce the risk of colon cancer, improve symptom management, and improve quality of life. Does that answer your question?"
