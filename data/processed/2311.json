        "gpt4": "Great. We'll first start with your diet for the days leading up to your procedure. You'll need to start a special diet two days before your examination. On the first day, you can have a light breakfast, such as toast and coffee. For the rest of the day, you will need to stick to clear liquids. This includes things like chicken broth, clear juices, or popsicles. Avoid consuming red or purple liquids as they can discolor the colon. Would you like me to send you a detailed list?",
        "our_model": "Excellent, thank you, Mr. Kageyama. Let's start with your diet. In the days leading up to your colonoscopy, it's important to follow a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. On the day before your procedure, you'll need to switch to a clear liquid diet. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. Do you have any questions about this dietary plan?"
