    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay about it, Mr. Kageyama. It's quite a process to go through this procedure. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy for preventative screening for colon cancer. How are you feeling about this?\n\nPatient: Well, as I said, I'm I'm fine. It's preventative.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Kageyama. It's great that you're taking this step to take care of your health. Do you have any questions or concerns about the procedure that you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions at any time during our conversation, feel free to ask. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent, thank you, Mr. Kageyama. Let's start with your diet. In the days leading up to your colonoscopy, it's important to follow a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. On the day before your procedure, you'll need to switch to a clear liquid diet. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. Do you have any questions about this dietary plan?\n\nPatient: Jell o, who I like Jell o, especially the cherry kind.",

        "gpt4": "Cherry Jell-O is a popular choice, Mr. Kageyama! Please remember to avoid any color that can stain, including red and purple, as this can affect the visibility during the procedure. Do you have any other questions about your diet or anything else related to the colonoscopy?",
        "our_model": "Cherry Jell-O is indeed a popular choice, Mr. Kageyama. It's great to hear that you enjoy it. It's one of the foods you can have on your clear liquid diet the day before your procedure. Do you usually make it at home or do you buy it from the store?"
