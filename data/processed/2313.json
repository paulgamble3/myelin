    "prompt": "Nurse: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Kageyama. It's great that you're taking this step to take care of your health. Do you have any questions or concerns about the procedure that you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions at any time during our conversation, feel free to ask. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent, thank you, Mr. Kageyama. Let's start with your diet. In the days leading up to your colonoscopy, it's important to follow a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. On the day before your procedure, you'll need to switch to a clear liquid diet. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. Do you have any questions about this dietary plan?\n\nPatient: Jell o, who I like Jell o, especially the cherry kind.\n\nNurse: Cherry Jell-O is indeed a popular choice, Mr. Kageyama. It's great to hear that you enjoy it. It's one of the foods you can have on your clear liquid diet the day before your procedure. Do you usually make it at home or do you buy it from the store?\n\nPatient: I'm making it home.",

        "gpt4": "Great to hear that you're making it at home, Mr. Kageyama. Please keep in mind that on the day before your procedure, you should avoid red and purple Jell-O since those colors can alter the results of the colonoscopy. All other colors should be fine. Do you have any other questions or is there anything else you'd like to know before your colonoscopy?",
        "our_model": "That's wonderful, Mr. Kageyama. Homemade Jell-O can be a real treat. Just remember to follow the dietary guidelines we discussed for your colonoscopy prep. Now, let's move on to your medication. You're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. It's essential to discuss with your doctor if you should continue taking this medication before your procedure. Have you had this discussion with Doctor Bailey yet?"
