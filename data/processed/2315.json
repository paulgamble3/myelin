    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent, thank you, Mr. Kageyama. Let's start with your diet. In the days leading up to your colonoscopy, it's important to follow a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. On the day before your procedure, you'll need to switch to a clear liquid diet. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. Do you have any questions about this dietary plan?\n\nPatient: Jell o, who I like Jell o, especially the cherry kind.\n\nNurse: Cherry Jell-O is indeed a popular choice, Mr. Kageyama. It's great to hear that you enjoy it. It's one of the foods you can have on your clear liquid diet the day before your procedure. Do you usually make it at home or do you buy it from the store?\n\nPatient: I'm making it home.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Kageyama. Homemade Jell-O can be a real treat. Just remember to follow the dietary guidelines we discussed for your colonoscopy prep. Now, let's move on to your medication. You're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. It's essential to discuss with your doctor if you should continue taking this medication before your procedure. Have you had this discussion with Doctor Bailey yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have. I said, yes, I have.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you've discussed this with Doctor Bailey, Mr. Kageyama. It's important to follow her instructions regarding your medication. Now, let's talk about the procedure day. On the day of your colonoscopy, you'll need to arrange for someone to drive you home afterwards, as you'll be sedated for the procedure. Do you have someone who can assist with this?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
