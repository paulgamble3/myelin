    "prompt": "Nurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Kageyama. Homemade Jell-O can be a real treat. Just remember to follow the dietary guidelines we discussed for your colonoscopy prep. Now, let's move on to your medication. You're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. It's essential to discuss with your doctor if you should continue taking this medication before your procedure. Have you had this discussion with Doctor Bailey yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have. I said, yes, I have.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you've discussed this with Doctor Bailey, Mr. Kageyama. It's important to follow her instructions regarding your medication. Now, let's talk about the procedure day. On the day of your colonoscopy, you'll need to arrange for someone to drive you home afterwards, as you'll be sedated for the procedure. Do you have someone who can assist with this?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's critical to have someone to help you out on the day of your procedure. Do you usually rely on family or friends for this kind of support, or do you have a different arrangement?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you have a support system in place, Mr. Kageyama. Family and friends can be a great help in situations like these. Now, I'll be calling you again the day before your procedure to check in and answer any last-minute questions you might have. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: Nope.",
