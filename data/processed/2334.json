I am.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Ponce. It's essential to continue taking these medications as prescribed. Now, I understand that managing multiple medications can sometimes be challenging. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time?\n\nPatient: No. Not really.\n\nNurse: That's fantastic, Mr. Ponce. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, with your permission, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Ponce. You mentioned earlier that you've gained weight and are experiencing shortness of breath. Have you noticed any increased swelling in your feet, ankles, stomach, or legs?\n\nPatient: Right now.",
