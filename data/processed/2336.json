    "prompt": "Nurse: That's fantastic, Mr. Ponce. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, with your permission, I'd like to ask a few more questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Ponce. You mentioned earlier that you've gained weight and are experiencing shortness of breath. Have you noticed any increased swelling in your feet, ankles, stomach, or legs?\n\nPatient: Right now.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Ponce. Swelling can be a sign of fluid buildup, which is something we want to monitor closely. Now, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Ponce. That's good to hear. We've just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to do this at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: And then I go.",
