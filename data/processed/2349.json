    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a healthy choice, Mr. Ponce. Olive oil is a good source of monounsaturated fats. Now, I'd like to remind you of your dietary recommendations. You're on a fluid restriction of 2 liters per day. This includes all fluids, not just water. Are you aware of this?\n\nPatient: Yes. I am.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Ponce. Now, let's talk about your sodium intake. You're recommended to follow a diet restricted to 1500 mg of sodium per day. This means being mindful of not just table salt, but also hidden sources of sodium in processed foods. Are you comfortable with this recommendation?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Ponce. Based on what you've told me about your meals, it seems like you're doing a good job with your diet. Just remember to be mindful of the sodium content in processed foods, like the sausage you mentioned earlier. Now, let's discuss your exercise routine. Can you tell me about any physical activities you've been doing recently?\n\nPatient: I started going for a walk around the park? Every other day for thirty minutes.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Ponce. Walking is a great form of exercise, especially for managing CHF. Do you enjoy your walks around the park?\n\nPatient: I really do.",
