    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great, Mr. Ponce. Now, let's talk about your sodium intake. You're recommended to follow a diet restricted to 1500 mg of sodium per day. This means being mindful of not just table salt, but also hidden sources of sodium in processed foods. Are you comfortable with this recommendation?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Ponce. Based on what you've told me about your meals, it seems like you're doing a good job with your diet. Just remember to be mindful of the sodium content in processed foods, like the sausage you mentioned earlier. Now, let's discuss your exercise routine. Can you tell me about any physical activities you've been doing recently?\n\nPatient: I started going for a walk around the park? Every other day for thirty minutes.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Ponce. Walking is a great form of exercise, especially for managing CHF. Do you enjoy your walks around the park?\n\nPatient: I really do.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Ponce. Enjoying your exercise routine is important for sticking with it. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Ponce. Given your current walking routine, a good way to enhance your exercise might be to gradually increase the duration or frequency of your walks, as long as you feel comfortable and it's approved by your doctor. For example, if you're currently walking for 30 minutes every other day, you might aim for 35 minutes or walk every day. How do you feel about this suggestion?",
        "our_model": "Great, Mr. Ponce. It's essential to start slow and gradually increase your activity level. For example, you could try to walk a little longer each day, or add an extra day of walking to your routine. Remember, it's always best to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that sound manageable to you?"
