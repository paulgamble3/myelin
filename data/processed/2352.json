    "prompt": "Nurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Ponce. Walking is a great form of exercise, especially for managing CHF. Do you enjoy your walks around the park?\n\nPatient: I really do.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Ponce. Enjoying your exercise routine is important for sticking with it. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Ponce. It's essential to start slow and gradually increase your activity level. For example, you could try to walk a little longer each day, or add an extra day of walking to your routine. Remember, it's always best to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that sound manageable to you?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Thank you very much.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Ponce. I'm glad to hear that you found the suggestions helpful. Remember, the goal is to gradually increase your activity level while listening to your body. Now, I understand that adjusting diet and exercise can be hard. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",
