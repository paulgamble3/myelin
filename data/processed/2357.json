It's a big step and it can indeed feel overwhelming. But as you've mentioned, it's a step you need to take for your well-being. You're going to have one of the most accomplished orthopedic surgeons, Dr. Cristina Stevens, by your side. She has performed over 1000 total knee replacements, so you're in excellent hands. \n\nOn a lighter note, have you thought about what you're looking forward to doing with your new knee? Maybe there's a particular activity you're looking forward to, or something you've missed doing because of your knee pain?",
