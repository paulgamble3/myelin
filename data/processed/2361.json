        "gpt4": "The goal of your total knee replacement surgery is indeed to relieve your pain and improve your mobility. Many patients find they're able to move around without pain after they have fully recovered from the surgery. However, keep in mind that recovery time can vary between individuals. Your doctor and physical therapists will provide you with a personalized treatment plan to help you regain strength and movement in your knee.",
        "our_model": "After the surgery, you will likely experience some pain as you heal. However, the pain you feel should be manageable with the medications your doctor will prescribe. Over time, as you recover and go through physical therapy, the pain will decrease and your mobility will improve. It's important to remember that this is a process and it will take some time to fully recover. Would you like to discuss anything else about the procedure?"
