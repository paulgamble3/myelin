    "prompt": "Nurse: It's a very common concern.\n\nPatient: Two.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: Do you think the pain my pain will get better after the surgery.\n\nNurse: Yes. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve pain and help you regain function in your knee. Most people experience significant pain relief and improved mobility after recovery. It's critical to remember that everyone's recovery is different, but your healthcare team, including Doctor Stevens, will be there to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else you're concerned about?\n\nPatient: No. No and yes. Yes and no. Will I be able to move around after the surgery without pain.\n\nNurse: After the surgery, you will likely experience some pain as you heal. However, the pain you feel should be manageable with the medications your doctor will prescribe. Over time, as you recover and go through physical therapy, the pain will decrease and your mobility will improve. It's important to remember that this is a process and it will take some time to fully recover. Would you like to discuss anything else about the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
