    "prompt": "Nurse: After the surgery, you will likely experience some pain as you heal. However, the pain you feel should be manageable with the medications your doctor will prescribe. Over time, as you recover and go through physical therapy, the pain will decrease and your mobility will improve. It's important to remember that this is a process and it will take some time to fully recover. Would you like to discuss anything else about the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Of course. What else would you like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yeah. How long is it?\n\nNurse: The actual surgery typically takes about 1 to 2 hours. However, the preparation before the surgery and the recovery time immediately after can add a few more hours to your hospital stay on the day of the procedure. After the surgery, you can expect to stay in the hospital for a few days, depending on your progress. Does that help?\n\nPatient: Yes. It helps. So okay. So typically one to two hours. Gotcha. And preparation makes sense. And how long is the recovery\n\nNurse: The recovery time varies from person to person, but generally, you can expect to use a walker or crutches for about 6 weeks. After that, you'll likely transition to a cane for a few more weeks. Full recovery can take anywhere from 3 to 6 months, but it's important to remember that everyone's recovery is unique. Your healthcare team will provide you with a more personalized timeline based on your progress. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: It does. Yes.",
