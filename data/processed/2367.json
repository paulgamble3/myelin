    "prompt": "Nurse: The actual surgery typically takes about 1 to 2 hours. However, the preparation before the surgery and the recovery time immediately after can add a few more hours to your hospital stay on the day of the procedure. After the surgery, you can expect to stay in the hospital for a few days, depending on your progress. Does that help?\n\nPatient: Yes. It helps. So okay. So typically one to two hours. Gotcha. And preparation makes sense. And how long is the recovery\n\nNurse: The recovery time varies from person to person, but generally, you can expect to use a walker or crutches for about 6 weeks. After that, you'll likely transition to a cane for a few more weeks. Full recovery can take anywhere from 3 to 6 months, but it's important to remember that everyone's recovery is unique. Your healthcare team will provide you with a more personalized timeline based on your progress. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: It does. Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to ask, have you been thinking about what you might like to do once your knee is feeling better?\n\nPatient: Oh, gosh. Just, you know, simply just walking. Freeway.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: Just walking freely.",
