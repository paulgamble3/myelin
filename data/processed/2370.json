    "prompt": "Patient: Just walking freely.\n\nNurse: That sounds wonderful.\n\nPatient: Freely walking simply.\n\nPatient: I just wanna walk without paying.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Walking without pain is a significant improvement and it's something you can look forward to. Now, let's move on to discuss some logistics about your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: That okay.",

        "gpt4": "Great, let's move on. Now, about food and drink. For 8 hours before your procedure, that means from midnight before, you're not going to be able to eat anything or drink any liquids, not even water. This is to ensure your safety during the anesthesia. Can you do that?",
        "our_model": "Great. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?"
