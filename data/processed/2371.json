Walking without pain is a significant improvement and it's something you can look forward to. Now, let's move on to discuss some logistics about your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: That okay.\n\nNurse: Great. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.",
