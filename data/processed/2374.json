    "prompt": "Nurse: Great. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Is there anything else about the logistics that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. What time should I arrive to the hospital?\n\nNurse: You should aim to arrive at the hospital around 1 hour before your procedure, so for your 9:00 AM procedure, you should plan to arrive at 8:00 AM. This will give you enough time to check in and prepare for your surgery. Does that help?\n\nPatient: That help. Yeah.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.",
