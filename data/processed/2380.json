    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, that's correct. Aspirin is a type of medication known as a blood thinner. It's usually stopped before surgery to reduce the risk of excessive bleeding during the procedure. Are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: I'm not taking any, so I'm good.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to avoid those medications unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Now, I notice you've also been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: I did.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's important to have those on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns?\n\nPatient: I don't know. I don't.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to discuss how to prepare your skin for surgery. This is an important step to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased a chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "That's excellent preparation. I would like to go over the use of the scrub, just to make sure the instructions are clear. You need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your knee operation. First, take your regular shower, then turn the water off. Is this clear so far?",
        "our_model": "That's great. You'll need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?"
