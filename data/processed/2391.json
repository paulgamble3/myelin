Now, I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a few more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Pretty you already answered all my questions.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness. Do you have a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No, ma'am.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure.
