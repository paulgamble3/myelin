Now, I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness. Do you have a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No, ma'am.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Still the plan. Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. It's essential to have a safe and comfortable place to recover after your procedure.
