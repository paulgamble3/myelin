    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness. Do you have a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No, ma'am.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Still the plan. Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. It's essential to have a safe and comfortable place to recover after your procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If you didn't have someone, you would still have time to arrange it, but it's good that you've already taken care of this. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: I'm pretty through. Thank you.",

Also, remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery. Finally, ensure you have a ride home arranged for after your procedure and someone to stay with you.\n\nCan I count on you to take care of these things?",
