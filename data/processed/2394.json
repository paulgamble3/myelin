    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Still the plan. Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. It's essential to have a safe and comfortable place to recover after your procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If you didn't have someone, you would still have time to arrange it, but it's good that you've already taken care of this. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: I'm pretty through. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. To summarize, before your procedure, remember to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Also, do not eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. After your procedure, you'll need to take your prescribed medications and continue with your physical therapy. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: You can count on me.",
