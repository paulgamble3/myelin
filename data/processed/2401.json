    "prompt": "Patient: Well, Generally speaking, I've been feeling fine. I'm just getting so tired of this pain in my knee.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing pain. It's certainly not easy dealing with such discomfort. It's great that you're taking steps to address it with the upcoming knee replacement. I'm sure you must be looking forward to getting a new knee. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once you've recovered?\n\nPatient: I would just like to be able to go for a walk and not being horrible pain.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Being able to enjoy a pain-free walk will be a significant improvement. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: Well, like I said, I'm I'm looking forward to it, but I'm also dreading it because I know I'm gonna be in a lot more pain after the surgery. But\n\nPatient: I just have to hang in there until things settle down, and hopefully, I'll be feeling better after a few weeks. Right?\n\nNurse: Absolutely. It's completely normal to have mixed feelings about a procedure like this. The initial recovery period can be challenging, but it's a crucial step towards long-term relief from your knee pain. And yes, with time and proper care, you should start feeling better. Before we move on, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: About the surgery.",
