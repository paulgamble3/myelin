    "prompt": "Patient: I would just like to be able to go for a walk and not being horrible pain.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Being able to enjoy a pain-free walk will be a significant improvement. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: Well, like I said, I'm I'm looking forward to it, but I'm also dreading it because I know I'm gonna be in a lot more pain after the surgery. But\n\nPatient: I just have to hang in there until things settle down, and hopefully, I'll be feeling better after a few weeks. Right?\n\nNurse: Absolutely. It's completely normal to have mixed feelings about a procedure like this. The initial recovery period can be challenging, but it's a crucial step towards long-term relief from your knee pain. And yes, with time and proper care, you should start feeling better. Before we move on, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: About the surgery.\n\nNurse: Of course. What would you like to know about the surgery?\n\nPatient: I just wanna know how soon after surgery will I start feeling better?",

        "gpt4": "The recovery period can vary for each person. Generally, the acute pain will steadily decrease in the first few weeks after surgery. After that, you might experience some soreness or mild pain, especially after physical therapy sessions or increased activity, but that gradually improves over time. Typically, patients notice significant improvement within 4-6 weeks. \n\nHowever, full recovery can take up to 3-6 months or even longer, depending on factors like your overall health, age and how well you follow your recommended rehabilitation program. Remember, it's crucial to follow your surgeon's instructions and continue with your rehabilitation protocol to ensure the best possible outcome.",
        "our_model": "That's a great question. Everyone's recovery process is unique, but generally, you can expect to start feeling some relief from your knee pain within a few weeks after surgery. However, it's important to remember that full recovery can take several months. During this time, physical therapy will play a crucial role in helping you regain strength and mobility in your knee. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the surgery?"
