    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely. It's completely normal to have mixed feelings about a procedure like this. The initial recovery period can be challenging, but it's a crucial step towards long-term relief from your knee pain. And yes, with time and proper care, you should start feeling better. Before we move on, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: About the surgery.\n\nNurse: Of course. What would you like to know about the surgery?\n\nPatient: I just wanna know how soon after surgery will I start feeling better?\n\nNurse: That's a great question. Everyone's recovery process is unique, but generally, you can expect to start feeling some relief from your knee pain within a few weeks after surgery. However, it's important to remember that full recovery can take several months. During this time, physical therapy will play a crucial role in helping you regain strength and mobility in your knee. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the surgery?\n\nPatient: No. I just hope I can hang in there. For that long.\n\nNurse: I can certainly appreciate your feelings. It's a big step, but remember, you're not alone in this. Your healthcare team, including Doctor Stevens and all of us at O'Connor Hospital, are here to support you every step of the way. Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to review a few topics to ensure you have everything you need for your procedure. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Okay.",
