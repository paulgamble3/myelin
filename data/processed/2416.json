    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medications you're currently taking?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's talk about how to prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. After that, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's essential to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great! Once the scrub is applied, you should then gently rub it into your skin for about 5 minutes. After this, you can rinse off the solution and pat yourself dry with a clean towel. Does all of this make sense to you?",
        "our_model": "Excellent. Finally, you'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?"
