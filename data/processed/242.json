Would you like to share what's been bothering you?\n\nPatient: Not really.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. O'Leary. I'm here to help you with any concerns you might have about your upcoming procedure.

The goal of this procedure is indeed to help you feel better and improve your quality of life. How are you feeling about the procedure itself?\n\nPatient: I guess I feel fine.",
