    "prompt": "Nurse: No problem at all. Let's move on to the next part of your preparation, which is when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No, not particularly.\n\nNurse: Alright. Let's proceed then. I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness recently. Have you had a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No. I have not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to be in the best possible health before your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
