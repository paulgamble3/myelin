        "gpt4": "Absolutely, we can definitely discuss the post-procedure information. How can I assist you specifically in that area?",
        "our_model": "Of course, Mr. O'Leary. After the procedure, you'll be taken to a recovery room where the immediate effects of the anesthesia can be monitored. Once you're awake and stable, you'll be moved to your hospital room. You'll likely stay in the hospital for a few days, possibly up to a week, depending on your progress. During this time, you'll start physical therapy to help strengthen your new knee. Do you have any specific concerns about this process?"
