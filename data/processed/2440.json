Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Oliver. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Oliver. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: One hundred twelve.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Oliver. Your blood sugar is a bit higher than the target range. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: What is the target range?",

        "gpt4": "Great question, Mr. Oliver. The Diabetes Association recommends a target range of 80-130 mg/dl before meals for adults with diabetes. So while your reading of 112mg/dL falls within this range, it's always good to aim for the lower end. Would it still be okay for me to go over some tips to keep your blood sugar levels well managed, especially relating to your meals?",
        "our_model": "The target range for fasting blood sugar levels in people with diabetes is usually between 80 and 130. Your recent reading of 112 is slightly above this range. Would you like some suggestions on how to lower your blood sugar levels?"
