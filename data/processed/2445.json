    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize for any confusion, Mr. Oliver. You're correct that 112 is within the range of 80 to 130. However, the target range for fasting blood sugar levels in people with diabetes is usually closer to the lower end of that range, around 80 to 100. It's great that you're keeping track of your blood sugar levels. Let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and what was the result?\n\nPatient: This morning, it was one forty four over Eighty four.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Oliver. Your blood pressure reading is a bit high. It's essential to keep an eye on this. May I share some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Oliver. One way to manage blood pressure is by reducing salt intake. This can be achieved by avoiding processed foods and not adding extra salt to meals. Also, regular physical activity, like the square dancing you're doing, can help lower blood pressure. Lastly, managing stress through relaxation techniques can also be beneficial. Does this information help?\n\nPatient: I guess.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Oliver. If you have any questions about your recent blood tests or urine labs, I'm here to help. Is there anything you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: What does GFR mean? And how is it measured?",

        "gpt4": "GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a measure of how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. The GFR is usually calculated using results from your blood creatinine test, your age, body size and gender. A GFR of 67 means your kidneys are working at about 67% of normal. Does that clarify things for you, Mr. Oliver?",
        "our_model": "GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A lower GFR can be a sign that your kidneys are not working as well as they should. Your GFR is 67 mL/min/1.73m2, which is slightly lower than the normal range. This is something your doctor will likely continue to monitor. Does that help clarify things, Mr. Oliver?"
