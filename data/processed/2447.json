    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Oliver. One way to manage blood pressure is by reducing salt intake. This can be achieved by avoiding processed foods and not adding extra salt to meals. Also, regular physical activity, like the square dancing you're doing, can help lower blood pressure. Lastly, managing stress through relaxation techniques can also be beneficial. Does this information help?\n\nPatient: I guess.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Oliver. If you have any questions about your recent blood tests or urine labs, I'm here to help. Is there anything you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: What does GFR mean? And how is it measured?\n\nNurse: GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A lower GFR can be a sign that your kidneys are not working as well as they should. Your GFR is 67 mL/min/1.73m2, which is slightly lower than the normal range. This is something your doctor will likely continue to monitor. Does that help clarify things, Mr. Oliver?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Oliver. Now, I'd like to review your medications with you to ensure everything is going well. You're currently taking Valsartan 40 mg once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "That's fantastic, Mr. Oliver. Taking your medications as prescribed is crucial to manage your health conditions. How about your Lantus injection, which you're advised to take 15 units twice a day? Are you taking that as prescribed as well?",
        "our_model": "That's great to hear, Mr. Oliver. Now, let's move on to your next medication. You're also prescribed Lantus 100 IU/mL prefilled pen, with a dosage of 15 units two times a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?"
