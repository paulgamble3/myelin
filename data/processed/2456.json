    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Oliver. Now, let's talk a bit about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: So I've been trying to eat a lot healthier. I've been needing a lot of salads. Specifically, I've been using a lot of the the Wishbone Italian salad dressing. Can you tell me how much salt is in that?\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear you're making an effort to eat healthier, Mr. Oliver. As for the Wishbone Italian salad dressing, it contains approximately 260 mg of sodium per serving, which is about 2 tablespoons. It's a good idea to be mindful of your sodium intake, especially with conditions like hypertension and kidney disease. Would you like some suggestions on how to reduce your sodium intake while still enjoying flavorful meals?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Oliver. One way to reduce sodium intake is by using herbs and spices instead of salt to flavor your food. You can also choose fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned ones, as canned vegetables often have added sodium. When it comes to salad dressings, you might consider making your own at home with olive oil, vinegar, and your favorite herbs. This way, you can control the amount of sodium. Does this sound doable to you?\n\nPatient: I guess so.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Oliver. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. If you have any other questions or concerns about your diet or anything else, feel free to share.\n\nPatient: Not right now.",
