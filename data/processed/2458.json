    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Oliver. One way to reduce sodium intake is by using herbs and spices instead of salt to flavor your food. You can also choose fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned ones, as canned vegetables often have added sodium. When it comes to salad dressings, you might consider making your own at home with olive oil, vinegar, and your favorite herbs. This way, you can control the amount of sodium. Does this sound doable to you?\n\nPatient: I guess so.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Oliver. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. If you have any other questions or concerns about your diet or anything else, feel free to share.\n\nPatient: Not right now.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Oliver. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. It was a pleasure speaking with you today. Take care and enjoy your square dancing!\n\nPatient: Oh, actually, I do have one question.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Oliver. What's your question?\n\nPatient: Do you have any habits I can pick up to help prevent going on dialysis?",
