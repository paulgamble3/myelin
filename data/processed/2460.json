Take care and enjoy your square dancing!\n\nPatient: Oh, actually, I do have one question.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Oliver. What's your question?\n\nPatient: Do you have any habits I can pick up to help prevent going on dialysis?\n\nNurse: That's a very important question, Mr. Oliver. There are several lifestyle habits that can help manage your kidney disease and potentially delay the need for dialysis. These include maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol. It's also crucial to manage your other health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, as they can impact your kidney health.

Do you have any specific concerns or questions about these habits?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Oliver, I'm here. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about the lifestyle habits I mentioned earlier?\n\nPatient: I said to know.",
