What's your question?\n\nPatient: Do you have any habits I can pick up to help prevent going on dialysis?\n\nNurse: That's a very important question, Mr. Oliver. There are several lifestyle habits that can help manage your kidney disease and potentially delay the need for dialysis. These include maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol. It's also crucial to manage your other health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, as they can impact your kidney health. Lastly, it's important to take your medications as prescribed and follow up with your doctor regularly. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about these habits?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Oliver, I'm here. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about the lifestyle habits I mentioned earlier?\n\nPatient: I said to know.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Oliver. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. It's great that you're proactive about your health. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices?\n\nPatient: Yes. I smoke a pack of cigarettes today.",
