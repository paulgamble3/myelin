Thank you for asking.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful to hear! Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week?\n\nPatient: Oh, I guess it's being back to my regular old routine.\n\nNurse: That's a good thing, having a routine can be comforting. Is there a particular part of your routine that you enjoy the most?\n\nPatient: Just knowing that I have a routine give me comfort and peace of mind.\n\nNurse: I see, having that sense of stability can indeed be reassuring. Before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, I wanted to ask if there are any symptoms or health concerns you've been experiencing lately that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I can't think of any off the top of my head.",
