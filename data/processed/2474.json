    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a good thing, having a routine can be comforting. Is there a particular part of your routine that you enjoy the most?\n\nPatient: Just knowing that I have a routine give me comfort and peace of mind.\n\nNurse: I see, having that sense of stability can indeed be reassuring. Before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, I wanted to ask if there are any symptoms or health concerns you've been experiencing lately that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I can't think of any off the top of my head.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. If you do have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, please feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. Since you have hypertension, it's important to monitor your blood pressure regularly. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you recall what the reading was?\n\nPatient: Well, last time I took it, I can't remember off the top of my head. I don't even remember what the reading is.",
