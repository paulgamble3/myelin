    "prompt": "Nurse: That's okay. It's critical to keep track of your blood pressure readings. May I share some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Cores.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: Of course.\n\nNurse: Thank you. One way to manage blood pressure is by reducing salt intake. This can be achieved by eating less processed foods and adding less salt to your meals. Do you think this is something you could try?\n\nPatient: I don't see why not.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Another strategy is regular physical activity. This could be as simple as a daily walk. Do you currently have any physical activities incorporated into your routine?\n\nPatient: I'll be honest, not really.",

Once you feel comfortable, you can gradually increase your physical activity. Do remember to consult with your doctor before starting any new exercise program. Shall we move on to discuss your recent labs?",
