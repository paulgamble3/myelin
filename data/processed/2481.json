    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. Another strategy is regular physical activity. This could be as simple as a daily walk. Do you currently have any physical activities incorporated into your routine?\n\nPatient: I'll be honest, not really.\n\nNurse: That's okay. Incorporating some form of physical activity into your routine can be beneficial for managing blood pressure. Would you consider adding a short walk to your day?\n\nPatient: I don't see one on.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand your response. Could you please clarify?\n\nPatient: Sure. I said I don't see why not. Not.\n\nNurse: Thank you for your response. Including a short walk in your day can be a good start. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What exactly are the results? I never got those.",

        "gpt4": "Of course. Let's look at some key results together. The GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is a measure of your kidney function, and yours was 101 mL/min/1.73m2 which is within the normal range. Sodium, which is important for fluid balance, was 139 mEq/L. Potassium, which is needed for nerve and muscle cell function, was 3.4 mEq/L. And creatinine, a waste product in the blood, was 0.6 mg/dL. All these are within normal limits. However, your Urine Albumin was 190 mg/g, which is a bit high. \n\nDoes this help? Or would you like to know about anything else?",
        "our_model": "I see, let me explain. Your GFR, which stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 101 mL/min/1.73m2. This is a measure of how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. A higher number is better. Your sodium level is 139 mEq/L, potassium is 3.4 mEq/L, BUN is 3.14 mmol/L, creatinine is 0.6 mg/dL, and urine albumin is 190 mg/g. These are all within normal ranges. Do you have any questions about these results?"
