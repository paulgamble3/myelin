        "our_model": "I understand that this can be confusing. Your GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a measure of how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. A higher number is better. Your GFR of 101 mL/min/1.73m2 is within the normal range, which means your kidneys are functioning well at this time. However, because you have Stage I Chronic Kidney Disease, it's important to monitor this and other lab values regularly. Does that help clarify things a bit?"
