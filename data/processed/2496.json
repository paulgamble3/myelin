        "gpt4": "That's a really good question. As a vegetarian, you're already on track with a diet that includes lots of fruits and vegetables. However, certain vegetables are high in potassium, which can be harmful in large amounts for people with Chronic Kidney Disease. Examples are potatoes, tomatoes, and spinach. If you like these foods, you might consider eating them in smaller amounts or less frequently. Does this information help you?",
        "our_model": "It's great that you're following a vegetarian diet. Generally, a diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products can help manage kidney disease. However, some vegetarian foods can be high in potassium and phosphorus, which can be harmful in large amounts if you have kidney disease. Would it be okay if I provide some suggestions on how to manage your diet?"
