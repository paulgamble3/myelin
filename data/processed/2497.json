        "gpt4": "Being mindful of your protein intake is important. While protein is necessary for our bodies, consuming too much can make your kidneys work harder. As a vegetarian, you may be relying on beans and lentils for protein, however, they are also high in potassium. Consider having smaller portions and leaching them before cooking to reduce potassium levels.\n\nAlso, some dairy alternatives, like almond milk, have added phosphates which aren't good for your kidneys. So, check labels before purchasing. \n\nFurthermore, not all fruits and vegetables are kidney-friendly as some may have high potassium content. Bananas, avocados, potatoes and oranges are higher in potassium, while apples, berries, and green beans are lower.\n\nRemember, balance is key, and all bodies react differently. It's essential to get regular blood tests to monitor mineral levels. You're doing great, and making these adjustments can help support your kidney health. Would you like information on any other aspects of your diet?",
        "our_model": "Thank you. For a kidney-friendly diet, it's important to limit foods high in potassium like bananas, oranges, and potatoes. Also, some dairy products and whole grains can be high in phosphorus. It's a good idea to choose foods that are low in added sugars and sodium. Do you think these are changes you could make?"
