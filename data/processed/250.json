        "gpt4": "Great. Remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery. On the morning of your surgery, take only the medications that your doctor has instructed you to with a small sip of water. Please bring all the medications you're currently taking, in their original bottles, with you to the hospital. Does it all make sense, Mr. O'Leary?",
