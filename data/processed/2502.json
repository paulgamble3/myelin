How have you been feeling since then?\n\nPatient: Well, I don't feel fit as a fiddle, so to speak, but I do feel good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling good overall. It's important to keep up with any physical or occupational therapy recommended after a CVA. Now, let's talk about your hypertension. How have you been managing your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: I guess I've been managing it just fine doing what the doctors tell me.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Following your doctor's advice is key in managing hypertension. Now, let's discuss your hyperlipidemia. Have you noticed any changes in your diet or lifestyle to help manage this condition?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I just do what the doctors tell me.\n\nNurse: That's a good approach.
