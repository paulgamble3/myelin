Have you noticed any changes in your diet or lifestyle to help manage this condition?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I just do what the doctors tell me.\n\nNurse: That's a good approach. Following your doctor's advice can help manage your hyperlipidemia effectively. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices?\n\nPatient: Oh, lord. No.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear! Not smoking is beneficial for your overall health and particularly important for managing your conditions. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I can't think of any rep this minute.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. If you ever have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out. To summarize, you've agreed to consider adding a short walk to your daily routine, and you're going to consult with your doctor or a dietitian before making any major changes to your diet.
