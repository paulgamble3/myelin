    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand your concern, Mr. Oliver. Your GFR is currently 67 mL/min/1.73m2, which is in the Stage II range of Chronic Kidney Disease. This means your kidneys are not functioning at their full capacity, but they are still doing their job. It's important to manage your conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, to help protect your kidneys. As for dialysis, it's typically not considered until a person's GFR drops to a very low level or they experience severe symptoms.\n\nPatient: Okay. Well, that's good to know. So I just gotta hang in there.\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Oliver, managing your conditions and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help support your kidney function. Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to ask a few questions about your blood sugar and blood pressure. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Oliver. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Oliver. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: One hundred and twelve.",

        "gpt4": "That's a good reading, Mr. Oliver. It's in the normal range for someone with diabetes, which is 80-130 before meals. Keeping your blood sugar levels within this range will help to reduce the risks of complications related to diabetes. Now, let's discuss your blood pressure. Do you remember when you last measured your blood pressure?",
        "our_model": "Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Oliver. A blood sugar level of 112 is within the target range for people with diabetes. It's great that you're keeping track of your blood sugar levels. Now, when was the last time you took your blood pressure measurement, and what was the result?"
