Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. O'Leary. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Right knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's okay with me.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. O'Leary. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That sounds good.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. O'Leary. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: Not really.",
