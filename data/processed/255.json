    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, thank you, Mr. O'Leary. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Right knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's okay with me.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. O'Leary. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That sounds good.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. O'Leary. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: Not really.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary.

        "gpt4": "Okay, Mr. O'Leary. As we discussed earlier, you need to stop taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day 7 days before the procedure. I see that you are also on some other medications: Celebrex 100 mg two times a day as needed, Atorvastatin 40 mg once a day, Lasix 20 mg two times a day, and Metoprolol 12.5 mg once a day. These medications should be taken as usual, except for the Aspirin. Are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aleve, or other blood thinners?",

Since you haven't stopped yet, it's important that you do so immediately. Do you have any questions about this medication change?"
