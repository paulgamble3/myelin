Are you still taking your Valsartan and Lasix tablets?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, and how about your Methotrexate?\n\nPatient: Mhmm. I am taking it\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's fine.",
