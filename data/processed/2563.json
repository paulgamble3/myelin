    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep track of these symptoms at home every day. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about your diet. Can you tell me about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: I just had a piece of toast with a cream cheese.",
