It's a good idea to keep track of these symptoms at home every day. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about your diet. Can you tell me about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: I just had a piece of toast with a cream cheese.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that.\n\nPatient: And a small salad?",
