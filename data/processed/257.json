    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay, Mr. O'Leary. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: Not really.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes. Let's get this over with.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your patience, Mr. O'Leary. As we discussed earlier, you were instructed to stop taking your Aspirin 81 mg once a day 7 days before the procedure. Since you haven't stopped yet, it's important that you do so immediately. Do you have any questions about this medication change?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: Just the aspirin, but I'm gonna stop taking it now.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you for confirming that, Mr. O'Leary. Just remember, these types of medications typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. So, it's good to stop taking the Aspirin from now. \n\nI also see in your chart that you've been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg and Oxycodone for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications yet?",
        "our_model": "That's a good decision, Mr. O'Leary. Stopping the Aspirin now will help prepare you for your surgery. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?"
