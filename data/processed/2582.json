Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: Honey and twelve.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Alex, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your last blood sugar reading?\n\nPatient: One hundred and twelve.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's critical to keep an eye on your blood sugar levels. If you're comfortable with it, I can provide some recommendations on how to manage your blood sugar levels. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay. One strategy is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating a variety of foods, but especially focusing on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. It's also important to limit foods high in sugar and unhealthy fats. Do you feel you're able to incorporate this into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
