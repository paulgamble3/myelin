    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Alex, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat when you last took your blood pressure and what the reading was?\n\nPatient: I took it three hours ago, and it was ninety over one cent.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Alex, I didn't quite understand the second part of your response. Could you please repeat what your blood pressure reading was?\n\nPatient: Ninety over a hundred and ten.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's essential to keep an eye on your blood pressure. If you're comfortable with it, I can provide some recommendations on how to manage your blood pressure. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent. One strategy is to maintain a healthy diet. This includes eating a variety of foods, but especially focusing on fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. It's also important to limit foods high in sodium. Do you feel you're able to incorporate this into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "That's great! Physical activity also helps to maintain a healthy blood pressure. Just like with managing blood sugar, a simple daily walk can make a difference. Lastly, limiting alcohol and avoiding tobacco can also benefit your blood pressure. Would you like to add anything else?",
        "our_model": "That's great to hear. Another strategy is regular physical activity. This could be as simple as a daily walk. Do you think you could incorporate some form of physical activity into your daily routine?"
