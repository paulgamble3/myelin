    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent. One strategy is to maintain a healthy diet. This includes eating a variety of foods, but especially focusing on fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. It's also important to limit foods high in sodium. Do you feel you're able to incorporate this into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Another strategy is regular physical activity. This could be as simple as a daily walk. Do you think you could incorporate some form of physical activity into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I can go for a walk around the park.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful. Walking is a great way to stay active and it can really help in managing your blood pressure. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: That's wonderful.

Can you read me those results?",

        "gpt4": "Of course, Alex. Let's focus on the key values one by one.\n\nFirstly, your sodium level is 139 mEq/L, which is within the expected range. Sodium is a type of electrolyte, and it helps with nerve and muscle function in our bodies.\n\nNext, your potassium level is 3.9 mEq/L, also in the normal range. Potassium, another type of electrolyte, is necessary for heart and kidney function.\n\nYour BUN level, which stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen and measures the amount of waste product in your blood, is 4.15 mmol/L. This is slightly high.\n\nYour creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, which is normal. Creatinine is a waste product produced by muscle metabolism, and healthy kidneys should filter it out effectively.\n\nLastly, your GFR, which stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 43 mL/min/1.73m2. This number tells us how well your kidneys are filtering waste from the blood. A number under 60 can indicate kidney disease.\n\nYour urine albumin level is 210 mg/g, which is high. Albumin is a type of protein, and larger amounts in the urine may indicate kidney disease.\n\n",

Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, which measures the amount of waste product in your blood, is 4.15 mmol/L. Your creatinine, a waste product that comes from the normal wear and tear on muscles, is 1.0 mg/dL. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, which measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood, is 43 mL/min/1.73m2. Lastly, your urine albumin, a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged, is 210 mg/g. Do you have any questions about these results?"
