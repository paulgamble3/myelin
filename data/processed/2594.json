    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. Another strategy is regular physical activity. This could be as simple as a daily walk. Do you think you could incorporate some form of physical activity into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I can go for a walk around the park.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful. Walking is a great way to stay active and it can really help in managing your blood pressure. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: That's wonderful. Walking in the park can be a great way to stay active. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Can you read me those results?\n\nNurse: Of course. Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 139 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 3.9 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, which measures the amount of waste product in your blood, is 4.15 mmol/L. Your creatinine, a waste product that comes from the normal wear and tear on muscles, is 1.0 mg/dL. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, which measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood, is 43 mL/min/1.73m2. Lastly, your urine albumin, a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged, is 210 mg/g. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: I do. What GFR means and how is measure?",

        "gpt4": "Of course, I'd be happy to clarify. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate, and it measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. It's calculated using a formula that includes your creatinine level, age, sex, and race. A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. Your GFR is 43, which suggests there could be some kidney damage. Your doctor is monitoring this carefully. Do you have any other questions about your lab results?",
        "our_model": "GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test that measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. It does this by checking the amount of a waste product called creatinine in your blood. A lower GFR can mean that your kidneys are not working as well as they should be. Your recent GFR was 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which is a bit lower than normal. It's important to keep an eye on this number. Does that help clarify things for you?"
