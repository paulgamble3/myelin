    "prompt": "Nurse: That's wonderful. Walking is a great way to stay active and it can really help in managing your blood pressure. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: That's wonderful. Walking in the park can be a great way to stay active. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Can you read me those results?\n\nNurse: Of course. Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 139 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 3.9 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, which measures the amount of waste product in your blood, is 4.15 mmol/L. Your creatinine, a waste product that comes from the normal wear and tear on muscles, is 1.0 mg/dL. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, which measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood, is 43 mL/min/1.73m2. Lastly, your urine albumin, a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged, is 210 mg/g. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: I do. What GFR means and how is measure?\n\nNurse: GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test that measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. It does this by checking the amount of a waste product called creatinine in your blood. A lower GFR can mean that your kidneys are not working as well as they should be. Your recent GFR was 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which is a bit lower than normal. It's important to keep an eye on this number. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. And how do I keep that number? What do I need to do?",

        "gpt4": "Maintaining a good GFR number can be achieved through a few key ways. It's important to manage your blood pressure and blood sugar levels, as you're already doing. A healthy diet can also support kidney health. This includes limiting your intake of salt, protein, and certain minerals. Finally, it's essential to stay hydrated and avoid overusing medications. You also have medications prescribed specifically for your condition. Can we go over these now to ensure you're taking them correctly?",
        "our_model": "Maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help keep your GFR at a good level. This includes eating a balanced diet, staying active, and managing your blood sugar and blood pressure. It's also important to take your medications as prescribed. Speaking of which, would it be alright if we go over your medications now?"
