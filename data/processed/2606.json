        "gpt4": "Sure. According to the nutrition information available online, one serving size, which is two tablespoons or 30ml, of Wish-Bone Italian Dressing contains approximately 280mg of sodium. Sodium is another term for salt. For a low-sodium diet, it's recommended to keep your intake below 2,000mg per day. Therefore, if you're using one serving of this dressing, it fits within a low-sodium diet but can add up fast if using more. I'd suggest using it sparingly, or you could also try making your own low-sodium dressing at home. Would you like some help on how to do that?",
        "our_model": "I'm sorry, Alex, but as an AI, I don't have the ability to look up specific products. However, I can provide some general advice. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label on food products, including dressings, to see how much sodium they contain. Would you like some general tips on how to reduce sodium in your diet?"
