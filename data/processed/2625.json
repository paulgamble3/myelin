What kind of shows do you all enjoy watching?\n\nPatient: going for walks, doing something together, painting,\n\nNurse: It sounds like you have a lovely time with your family, Ms. Cruz. Painting is a wonderful way to express creativity. Do you have a favorite subject or style that you like to paint?\n\nPatient: No style free dial.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Ms. Cruz. Painting without boundaries can be very freeing. Now, I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Jeff Crane and I have a few topics to cover with you. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: Mhmm.No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Cruz. Let's move on to your medications. Have you been able to pick up your new prescription for Captopril 12.5 mg oral tablet?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",

        "gpt4": "Great! You're doing well by taking the initiative to pick up your medication, Ms. Cruz. Remember the dosage is 6.25mg, not the 12.5mg as the whole tablet. The medication needs to be taken two times a day. Have you been taking it as prescribed?",
        "our_model": "Excellent, Ms. Cruz. For the Captopril, you should be taking 6.25 mg two times a day. Are you following this dosage?"
