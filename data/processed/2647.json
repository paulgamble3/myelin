    "prompt": "Nurse: That's okay, Ms. Cruz. It's essential to keep an eye on any sudden weight changes as they can be a sign of fluid retention. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Cruz. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to do this at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: I do not have questions. Thank you.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Ms. Cruz. Could you please confirm if you've been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No. I do not.\n\nNurse: I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you.\n\nPatient: Thank you.",
