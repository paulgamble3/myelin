    "prompt": "Nurse: I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you. I apologize for the inconvenience, Mr. O'Leary. I was saying that I notice you've been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed and Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. O'Leary. It's essential to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these or any other medications?\n\nPatient: I don't have any questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. Now, let's talk about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes. I already purchased it.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. O'Leary. You're well-prepared. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes. That sounds fine.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. O'Leary. After you've taken a shower like normal and turned off the water, you'll want to apply the chlorhexidine scrub to a wet, clean washcloth. Then, gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's important to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or genital area. Does that seem manageable for you?",
        "our_model": "Okay, Mr. O'Leary. After taking a shower like normal, you'll turn the water off. Then, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's essential to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?"
