This can be a sign of fluid retention, which is something we want to avoid with CHF.

        "gpt4": "That's a great question, Ms. Cruz. You should weigh yourself each morning after using the restroom and before eating or drinking anything. It's best to use the same scale each day and to wear similar clothing when you weigh yourself. This will give you the most accurate measurement. Is there anything else you'd like to know?",
        "our_model": "I understand that adjusting to a new diet can be challenging, Ms. Cruz. You're doing a great job following the recommendations, but I understand that you miss your regular food. It's critical to weigh yourself at the same time each day, preferably in the morning before you eat breakfast. This can help you notice any sudden weight changes that might indicate fluid retention. Does that help clarify things for you?"
