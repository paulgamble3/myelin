    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand, Ms. Cruz. Changing our diet can feel restrictive, especially when we miss our favorite foods. It's essential to weigh yourself daily, preferably at the same time each day, and look for any sudden increases. This can be a sign of fluid retention, which is something we want to avoid with CHF. Would you like more information on how to manage your diet while still enjoying your meals?\n\nPatient: do I do it after breakfast or before I eat breakfast?\n\nNurse: I understand that adjusting to a new diet can be challenging, Ms. Cruz. You're doing a great job following the recommendations, but I understand that you miss your regular food. It's critical to weigh yourself at the same time each day, preferably in the morning before you eat breakfast. This can help you notice any sudden weight changes that might indicate fluid retention. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Cruz. Now, let's talk about exercise. Could you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: I really don't exercise. Why?\n\nNurse: I understand, Ms. Cruz. Exercise can be challenging, especially when you're not feeling your best. With your permission, I'd like to provide some recommendations about how you might be able to incorporate some light exercise into your routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Okay. Let's Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you for letting me share, Ms. Cruz. Considering your current health conditions, it's important to start gradually. Light activities like walking at a comfortable pace can be a good starting point. May I ask if your area is suitable for taking short, leisurely walks?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Ms. Cruz. One way to start is by incorporating more walking into your day. For example, you could try to take a short walk after meals. Start with a few minutes and gradually increase as you feel comfortable. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that sound manageable to you?"
