    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand that adjusting to a new diet can be challenging, Ms. Cruz. You're doing a great job following the recommendations, but I understand that you miss your regular food. It's critical to weigh yourself at the same time each day, preferably in the morning before you eat breakfast. This can help you notice any sudden weight changes that might indicate fluid retention. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Cruz. Now, let's talk about exercise. Could you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: I really don't exercise. Why?\n\nNurse: I understand, Ms. Cruz. Exercise can be challenging, especially when you're not feeling your best. With your permission, I'd like to provide some recommendations about how you might be able to incorporate some light exercise into your routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Okay. Let's Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. Cruz. One way to start is by incorporating more walking into your day. For example, you could try to take a short walk after meals. Start with a few minutes and gradually increase as you feel comfortable. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that sound manageable to you?\n\nPatient: I love walking, so I can do that.",
