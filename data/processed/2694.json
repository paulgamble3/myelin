Also, try to eat a diet rich in veggies, whole grains, lean proteins, and limit sugary foods and drinks. It's also important to take your diabetes medications as prescribed by your doctor. If you find that your blood sugar levels remain consistently high, please reach out to your healthcare provider. They may need to adjust your treatment plan. Does this sound manageable, Ms. Aguirre?",
