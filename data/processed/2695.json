    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Aguirre. It's a bit higher than the target range for fasting blood sugar levels. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: No. That's okay.\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion earlier, Ms. Aguirre. You mentioned that your last blood sugar reading was 128. Is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you. Thank you for confirming that, Ms. Aguirre. It's critical to keep an eye on your blood sugar levels. If it's alright with you, I'd like to share some suggestions on how to manage your blood sugar levels. Would that be okay?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. Aguirre. One strategy is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, rather than having one or two large meals. This can help prevent blood sugar spikes and crashes.
