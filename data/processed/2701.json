    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Aguirre. Your blood pressure reading is a bit higher than the ideal range. Would it be okay if I share some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. Aguirre. One suggestion is to reduce your sodium intake. This can be achieved by eating less processed foods and adding less salt to your meals. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: No. Don't wait.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Aguirre, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: Sounds fine.\n\nNurse: Thank you for your response, Ms. Aguirre. Another suggestion is to increase your intake of fruits and vegetables, as they are naturally low in sodium and can help lower blood pressure. Do you think you could try that?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
