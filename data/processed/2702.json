        "gpt4": "I can understand why you might be curious about that, Ms. Aguirre. Sodium and caffeine can affect specific lab results, including your GFR, which stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. GFR tells us how well your kidneys are filtering wastes from your blood. Your recent GFR result was 28 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates your kidneys are functioning less efficiently than normal. High sodium and caffeine can put extra strain on your kidneys, so it's ideal to limit your intake of these substances.
