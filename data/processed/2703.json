    "prompt": "Patient: Sounds fine.\n\nNurse: Thank you for your response, Ms. Aguirre. Another suggestion is to increase your intake of fruits and vegetables, as they are naturally low in sodium and can help lower blood pressure. Do you think you could try that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Aguirre. Including more fruits and vegetables in your diet can have many health benefits. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I wasn't looking to\n\nPatient: of caffeine and sodiumine.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Aguirre, I didn't quite understand your question. Could you please repeat it?\n\nPatient: What does the potassium and sodium mean?",

        "gpt4": "Sure, Ms. Aguirre, I can explain that. Potassium and sodium are two minerals that are important for your body's function. The normal range for sodium in the blood is between 135 and 145 mEq/L, and your level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. This means your body has a healthy balance. Potassium's normal range is between 3.5 and 5.1 mEq/L and your level is 4.5 mEq/L, which is also within the normal range. This tells us that your kidneys are effectively managing these minerals in your body. Is that helpful?",
        "our_model": "Of course, Ms. Aguirre. Sodium and potassium are both types of electrolytes, which are minerals in your body that have an electric charge. They are necessary for your body to function properly. Sodium helps control your body's fluid balance and also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Potassium helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, to function properly. The normal range for sodium is typically between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). The normal range for potassium is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 mEq/L. Your sodium level was 137 mEq/L and your potassium level was 4.5 mEq/L, which are both within the normal ranges. Does that help clarify things for you?"
