    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Aguirre, I didn't quite understand your question. Could you please repeat it?\n\nPatient: What does the potassium and sodium mean?\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Aguirre. Sodium and potassium are both types of electrolytes, which are minerals in your body that have an electric charge. They are necessary for your body to function properly. Sodium helps control your body's fluid balance and also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Potassium helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, to function properly. The normal range for sodium is typically between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). The normal range for potassium is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 mEq/L. Your sodium level was 137 mEq/L and your potassium level was 4.5 mEq/L, which are both within the normal ranges. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Ms. Aguirre. I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, let's move on to your medications. You're currently taking Metformin 500 mg once a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Aguirre. Regularly taking your medication as prescribed is crucial in managing your conditions. Now, let's discuss the next medication. You're also prescribed Tylenol 500 mg, and the dosage is 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as directed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
