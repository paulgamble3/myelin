    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, Ms. Aguirre. Sodium and potassium are both types of electrolytes, which are minerals in your body that have an electric charge. They are necessary for your body to function properly. Sodium helps control your body's fluid balance and also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Potassium helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, to function properly. The normal range for sodium is typically between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). The normal range for potassium is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 mEq/L. Your sodium level was 137 mEq/L and your potassium level was 4.5 mEq/L, which are both within the normal ranges. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Ms. Aguirre. I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, let's move on to your medications.
