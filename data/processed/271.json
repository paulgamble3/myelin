    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. O'Leary. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: I can.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. O'Leary. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a few more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I guess I wanna know that\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. O'Leary. What would you like to know?\n\nPatient: or rather I wanna know how to manage my obesity and finally lose some weight",

        "gpt4": "I appreciate your desire to improve your health, Mr. O'Leary. Though I can't provide a personalized diet plan, it's generally recommended to follow a balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, while limiting sugary, processed and fast foods. Regular physical activity, as per your capacity, is also beneficial. After your procedure, physical therapy will play a crucial role in your recovery. And over time, as your knee heals, it will be easier for you to engage in more physical activities. Leading an active lifestyle coupled with a balanced diet can help support weight loss. You're on a good path already with upcoming surgery to relieve your osteoarthritis pain, and potentially improve your ability to exercise. Does that help answer your question, Mr. O'Leary? ",
        "our_model": "That's a great question, Mr. O'Leary. Managing weight, especially after a procedure like a total knee replacement, is an important part of overall health. It's best to discuss this with your doctor or a dietitian who can provide a personalized plan. However, generally, a balanced diet with portion control and regular physical activity can help manage weight. Would you like me to arrange a consultation with a dietitian for you?"
