        "gpt4": "With Stage IV chronic kidney disease (CKD), it's important to follow a balanced diet that helps manage your condition and supports your overall health. The diet should focus on foods that are low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus, which is beneficial for your kidneys. \n\nProtein intake also needs to be monitored. Lean proteins such as chicken, turkey, and fish are better choices than red meats, which can make kidneys work harder. \n\nFruits and vegetables are also important. However, you might need to avoid certain ones that are high in potassium, like bananas, avocados, and potatoes. Apples, berries, and bell peppers are some good options.\n\nCarbohydrates should come from whole grains when possible. Foods like whole grain bread, brown rice, and quinoa are better choices than white bread and regular pasta.\n\nDoes this information help, Ms. Aguirre?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question, Ms. Aguirre. As a Stage IV CKD patient, it's important to follow a diet that's low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. This means avoiding processed foods, which often have high sodium content, and limiting high-potassium foods like bananas, oranges, and potatoes. Instead, you can focus on foods like apples, berries, and vegetables like green beans and cabbage. For protein, you might consider lean meats like chicken or fish, and for grains, you can have white rice or pasta. Would you like more detailed suggestions or does this give you a good starting point?"
