    "prompt": "Nurse: That's excellent, Ms. Aguirre. It's critical to take your medications as prescribed to manage your conditions effectively. I want to remind you that there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for patients with chronic kidney disease to take. It's always best to talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Aguirre. If you ever have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask your doctor or a pharmacist. Now, let's talk a bit about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Yeah. So I'm a low carb, low salt diet, what food should I be eating since I'm a stage four CKD patient?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Ms. Aguirre. As a Stage IV CKD patient, it's important to follow a diet that's low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. This means avoiding processed foods, which often have high sodium content, and limiting high-potassium foods like bananas, oranges, and potatoes. Instead, you can focus on foods like apples, berries, and vegetables like green beans and cabbage. For protein, you might consider lean meats like chicken or fish, and for grains, you can have white rice or pasta. Would you like more detailed suggestions or does this give you a good starting point?\n\nPatient: That's a good starting point.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Aguirre. Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized dietary advice. Now, let's discuss your back surgeries. How has your recovery been going?\n\nPatient: Fine.",
