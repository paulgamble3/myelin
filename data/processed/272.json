    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great, Mr. O'Leary. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a few more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I guess I wanna know that\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. O'Leary. What would you like to know?\n\nPatient: or rather I wanna know how to manage my obesity and finally lose some weight\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. O'Leary. Managing weight, especially after a procedure like a total knee replacement, is an important part of overall health. It's best to discuss this with your doctor or a dietitian who can provide a personalized plan. However, generally, a balanced diet with portion control and regular physical activity can help manage weight. Would you like me to arrange a consultation with a dietitian for you?\n\nPatient: Can you give me some advice on what food that should and should not eat to lose weight.",

        "gpt4": "Certainly, Mr. O'Leary. As a general guideline, a nutrient-rich diet can aid in weight loss and overall health. \n\n1. Aim for whole, unprocessed foods: These include fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, whole grains, and healthy fats. \n2. Limit sugary foods and drinks: Sugary foods and drinks, like sodas and desserts, can add a lot of empty calories to your diet. \n3. Drink plenty of water: Sometimes, our bodies might confuse thirst for hunger. By staying properly hydrated, you can help curb unnecessary snacking. \n4. Eat smaller, more frequent meals: Instead of having 2-3 large meals in a day, try to divide it into 5-6 smaller meals. This can help your metabolism and control your hunger.\n\nHowever, it's essential to remember that everyone's body responds differently to dieting, so it might take a while to figure out what works best for you. After your knee replacement, you'll also want to consider working in some physical activity, as recommended by your surgeon, to help with your weight loss. Does this help, Mr. O'Leary?",
        "our_model": "Absolutely, Mr. O'Leary. For weight loss, it's generally recommended to focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. It's also beneficial to limit foods high in saturated fats, trans fats, and added sugars. This includes fried foods, processed snacks, and sugary drinks. It's also important to stay hydrated and drink plenty of water. Remember, everyone's dietary needs are different, so it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Does that help?"
