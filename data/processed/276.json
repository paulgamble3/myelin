    "prompt": "Patient: Can you give me some advice on what food that should and should not eat to lose weight.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. O'Leary. For weight loss, it's generally recommended to focus on a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. It's also beneficial to limit foods high in saturated fats, trans fats, and added sugars. This includes fried foods, processed snacks, and sugary drinks. It's also important to stay hydrated and drink plenty of water. Remember, everyone's dietary needs are different, so it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice. Does that help?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. O'Leary. Now, I have a few more questions for you. Have you noticed any signs of illness recently, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. O'Leary. It's critical to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: I'm going home after the procedure.\n\nNurse: Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you.",

        "gpt4": "That's correct, Mr. O'Leary. After the procedure, there will be a short recovery period in the hospital, and then you're scheduled to continue your recovery at home. Our care team will provide you with detailed instructions about your post-discharge care, including medication management, wound care, and physical therapy exercises. Please ensure that there's someone who can assist you at home, especially during the first few days. Do you have any questions about the discharge plan?",
