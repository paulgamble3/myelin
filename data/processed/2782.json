    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, if any questions come up during our conversation, feel free to ask at any time. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy as a preventative screening for colon cancer. It can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: You know, again, just really ready to get it over with.\n\nNurse: I can appreciate that sentiment. It's great that you're taking this step to take care of your health. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy. Is that okay?\n\nPatient: It would be okay.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our list. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Can I ask you a question first?\n\nNurse: Of course, you're welcome to ask any questions. What would you like to know?\n\nPatient: Well, what is colorectal cancer?",

        "gpt4": "Absolutely, it's good to be informed. Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the large intestine. This part of your digestive system processes food for energy and rids the body of solid waste. Colorectal cancer typically starts as small, benign clusters of cells called polyps. Some of these polyps can become colon cancers over time.\n\nAccording to the data, colon cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. The good news is that colonoscopies, like the one you're scheduled for, can detect colon cancer in the earliest stages, reducing the risk significantly. Let's return to the topic of your colonoscopy preparation. Have you received instructions regarding dietary restrictions before the procedure?",
        "our_model": "Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the colon or rectum. It usually starts as a growth called a polyp in the inner lining of the colon or rectum. Over time, some polyps can turn into cancer. That's why colonoscopies are important - they can detect these polyps in their early stages, when they're easier to remove and treat. Does that help clarify things for you?"
