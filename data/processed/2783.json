    "prompt": "Nurse: I can appreciate that sentiment. It's great that you're taking this step to take care of your health. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy. Is that okay?\n\nPatient: It would be okay.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our list. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Can I ask you a question first?\n\nNurse: Of course, you're welcome to ask any questions. What would you like to know?\n\nPatient: Well, what is colorectal cancer?\n\nNurse: Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the colon or rectum. It usually starts as a growth called a polyp in the inner lining of the colon or rectum. Over time, some polyps can turn into cancer. That's why colonoscopies are important - they can detect these polyps in their early stages, when they're easier to remove and treat. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: And what are the common risk factors for developing it?",

        "gpt4": "There are several risk factors associated with the development of colorectal cancer. Some of them include:\n\n1. Age - Colorectal cancer is more common among older adults.\n2. Lifestyle - Factors such as diet (processed meats), lack of physical activity, overweight or obesity, alcohol, and tobacco use can increase the risk.\n3. Family history - If a close family member (parent, sibling, or child) has had colorectal cancer, your likelihood of developing it increases.\n4. Certain genetic mutations - These can increase the risk significantly and lead to a family pattern of colorectal cancer and other cancers.\n5. Ethnic background - For reasons that aren't clear yet, people of Eastern European Jewish (Ashkenazi) descent have one of the highest colorectal cancer risks of any ethnic group in the world.\n\nRegular colonoscopies, like the one you're having, can help catch signs of colorectal cancer early, improving outcomes. Is there any other information that would be helpful for you?",
        "our_model": "Common risk factors for colorectal cancer include age, family history of the disease, a diet high in red and processed meats, and a sedentary lifestyle. It's also more common in individuals who are overweight or obese, smoke, or have type 2 diabetes. Regular screenings, like the one you're having, can help detect any potential issues early. Do you have any other questions before we move on to discussing the procedure?"
