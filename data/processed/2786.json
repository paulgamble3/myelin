    "prompt": "Nurse: Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the colon or rectum. It usually starts as a growth called a polyp in the inner lining of the colon or rectum. Over time, some polyps can turn into cancer. That's why colonoscopies are important - they can detect these polyps in their early stages, when they're easier to remove and treat. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: And what are the common risk factors for developing it?\n\nNurse: Common risk factors for colorectal cancer include age, family history of the disease, a diet high in red and processed meats, and a sedentary lifestyle. It's also more common in individuals who are overweight or obese, smoke, or have type 2 diabetes. Regular screenings, like the one you're having, can help detect any potential issues early. Do you have any other questions before we move on to discussing the procedure?\n\nPatient: No, ma'am. Thank you so much.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, I'm glad I could provide the information you needed. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure. Let's start with the first item on our checklist. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, it's important to follow those dietary guidelines for the best results. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. I will be there.",
