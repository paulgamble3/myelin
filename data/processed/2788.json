Are you clear on the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, it's important to follow those dietary guidelines for the best results.

Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. I will be there.\n\nNurse: Perfect, punctuality is key for these procedures.
