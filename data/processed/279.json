        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. O'Leary. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling prepared. Just to summarize, before your procedure, remember to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Also, do not eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. After your procedure, you'll need to follow your doctor's instructions and take your medications as prescribed. Can I count on you to do all of this?"
