    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: No. I understand.\n\nNurse: Great, it's important to stick to this diet to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Pasta.\n\nNurse: Pasta is a great choice for a low fiber diet. Do you have a favorite pasta dish that you're planning to enjoy during this time?\n\nPatient: I just like regular old spaghetti.\n\nNurse: Spaghetti is a classic choice, and it's perfect for a low fiber diet. You can enjoy it with a simple sauce, just remember to avoid high fiber ingredients. This is one of those rare times when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're considering?\n\nPatient: No. No questions about diet at all.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, if any dietary questions crop up later, don't hesitate to ask. We're nearing the end of our conversation, Shizu, just a few more things to cover. The day before your procedure, on August 12th, you will need to only have clear liquids and take the prescribed prep solution to clean out your colon. If you need a reminder or more information, we will be calling on that day as well to guide you through the process. Are we clear on this?",
        "our_model": "Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to discuss supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?"
