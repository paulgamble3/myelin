You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear.

Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the next part of your preparation. I'd like to discuss the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: A little anxious, but, again, I've done it before. Four.
