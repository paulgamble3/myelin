    "prompt": "Patient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to avoid those supplements and medications to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the next part of your preparation. I'd like to discuss the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: A little anxious, but, again, I've done it before. Four. I'm just ready to get it over with.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nNurse: I hear you, it's quite common to feel a bit anxious about this part. But remember, you've done it before and you know what to expect. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough.

        "gpt4": "Fantastic. Please remember that though this may not be the most pleasant part, it's an important step for the procedure. I want to remind you that you don't have to do anything just yet. You'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids, which involves not consuming any solid foods and drinking either clear or light-colored beverages without any red or purple dye. I'm curious, would you like me to share some examples of what clear liquids are, and you can let me know what questions you have about the diet?",
