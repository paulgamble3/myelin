    "prompt": "Patient: A little anxious, but, again, I've done it before. Four. I'm just ready to get it over with.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nNurse: I hear you, it's quite common to feel a bit anxious about this part. But remember, you've done it before and you know what to expect. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I do not.\n\nNurse: Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: I don't\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: I don't have any questions since I've done it before. I definitely understand what you mean by clear liquid diet.",

        "gpt4": "Great, it's excellent that you're already familiar with the clear liquid diet. By now, you know the drill: it's all about water, green tea, clear broth, light-colored sports drinks, and Jello without fruit or red color. But it's always good to go over it as a refresher. Do you have any remaining questions about the clear liquid diet, or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?",
        "our_model": "I see, That's great to hear. I'm glad you're familiar with the clear liquid diet. Just to confirm, this includes water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. If any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the other main step to remember, which is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?"
