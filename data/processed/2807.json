    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: I don't\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: I don't have any questions since I've done it before. I definitely understand what you mean by clear liquid diet.\n\nNurse: I see, That's great to hear. I'm glad you're familiar with the clear liquid diet. Just to confirm, this includes water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. If any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the other main step to remember, which is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. Thank you.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you change your mind and want some tips later, don't hesitate to ask. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: Nope.",

        "gpt4": "Great. Moving on to the last part of your prep. This involves when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. This is known as NPO, or nil per os, which is Latin for \"nothing through the mouth\". Do you have any questions about this or any other aspect of your prep?",
