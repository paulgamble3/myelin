I definitely understand what you mean by clear liquid diet.\n\nNurse: I see, That's great to hear. I'm glad you're familiar with the clear liquid diet. Just to confirm, this includes water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. If any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the other main step to remember, which is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. Thank you.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you change your mind and want some tips later, don't hesitate to ask. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. No questions.",
