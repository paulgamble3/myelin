You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. No questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have 2 more questions for you. Before we move on, do you have any questions or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. There's nothing I'd like to discuss. I have no questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the first of my last two questions. Have you been experiencing any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
