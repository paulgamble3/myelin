    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's critical to have someone available to take you home after the procedure. Do you have any questions about the logistics of the day of the procedure or anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No, ma'am. I have no questions at all.\n\nNurse: Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: As I said, no.\n\nNurse: Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over the dietary restrictions, medication guidelines, and the bowel prep process. You've confirmed that you've arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: That is right.",
