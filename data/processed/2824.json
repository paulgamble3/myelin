How are you feeling about the procedure?\n\nPatient: Fine, I guess.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. It's normal to have some feelings about a procedure like this. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss before we go over some details about the colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to pus and mucus in your stool. I know it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Fine.",
