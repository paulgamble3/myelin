    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Fine.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure. Let's start with the first topic. Are you aware of the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 10:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yep. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you for confirming. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
