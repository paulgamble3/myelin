    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, thank you for confirming. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Is there anything else about the logistics that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, I'm glad to hear that. I'm here to make this process as smooth as possible for you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to move on?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day. Given the instructions for your colonoscopy, you will need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
