    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, I'm glad to hear that. I'm here to make this process as smooth as possible for you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to move on?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day. Given the instructions for your colonoscopy, you will need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any questions about stopping Xarelto or any concerns about this medication change?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, thank you for confirming. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: Nope.",

        "gpt4": "Good to know. Those medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless the doctor specifically recommended otherwise. If you have any questions about stopping those medications in the future, remember to double-check with your doctor. Is everything clear about medications, or do you have any other questions on this topic?",
