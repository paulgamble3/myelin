    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods or is there anything you're unsure about?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, thank you for your response. I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: I like rice.\n\nNurse: Rice is a great choice, it's low in fiber and can be quite comforting. You can have it in various ways, like plain white rice or even in a rice pudding. Do you usually have it in a particular way that you enjoy?\n\nPatient: I just like it plain.\n\nNurse: Plain rice is a good option, it's simple and easy to digest. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss about your diet or shall we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: We can move on.",
