    "prompt": "Nurse: Plain rice is a good option, it's simple and easy to digest. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss about your diet or shall we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: We can move on.\n\nNurse: Alright, thank you. The next topic is about supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to avoid those supplements and medications before a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, thank you for your response. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I mean, I'm not soaked or anything, but It is what it is.",
