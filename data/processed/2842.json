    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, thank you. The next topic is about supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to avoid those supplements and medications before a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, thank you for your response. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I mean, I'm not soaked or anything, but It is what it is.\n\nNurse: I hear you, it's not the most pleasant part of the process, but it's necessary for a successful colonoscopy. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Not at the moment. No.",

        "gpt4": "That's good to hear. You don't have to start this part of the preparation just yet. But 24 hours before your procedure, you'll need to start your bowel prep by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share a few examples of what clear liquids are, and you can tell me if you have any questions about the diet?",
