    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to avoid those supplements and medications before a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, thank you for your response. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I mean, I'm not soaked or anything, but It is what it is.\n\nNurse: I hear you, it's not the most pleasant part of the process, but it's necessary for a successful colonoscopy. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Not at the moment. No.\n\nNurse: Alright, thank you for your response. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
