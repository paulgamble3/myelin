    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, thank you for your response. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's essential to note that you should avoid any liquids that are red or purple. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: Nope. Makes sense so far.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, thank you for your response. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great. One tip patients find helpful is drinking the laxative solution when it's cold, as some people find it more palatable that way. Another tip is to drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips? Are they something you might find helpful?",
