It's essential to note that you should avoid any liquids that are red or purple. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: Nope. Makes sense so far.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, thank you for your response. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, here are a few tips. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it easier to drink. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. Do you have any questions about these tips or is there anything else you'd like to know about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: Nope. I think we about covered it. What else do we need to talk about the we can get out of here.",
