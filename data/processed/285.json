Is this Damian Benton?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Hello Damian, I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Marta Marcuso, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately?\n\nPatient: Fine. What do you want?\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear you're doing fine. I'm here to discuss a few topics related to your health. Before we dive into that, is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not. Actually, I'm gonna have a terrible week.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nPatient: Because everything's terrible. And, yeah, it sucks out here.",
