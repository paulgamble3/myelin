    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, thank you for your response. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we move on, do you have any questions or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, thank you for your response. My next question is about your current health status. Do you have any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to be in good health before your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's important to have someone available to take you home after the procedure. You're doing a great job preparing for your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions or concerns about anything we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: Nope.",
