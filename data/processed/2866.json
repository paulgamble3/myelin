Protein, particularly from animal sources, can be hard on your kidneys, so make sure you're not consuming too much. Also, limit your intake of sodium, potassium, and phosphorus - these are commonly found in many foods but are processed by kidneys and can build up if your kidneys aren't functioning well. Make sure you are getting enough calories to keep up your energy. Lastly, hydration is key but don't overdo it.

Would you like me to set an appointment with your dietician for further dietary guidance?",
