    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful. One important thing to consider is your protein intake. While it's important to include protein in your diet, too much can put a strain on your kidneys. Try to include more plant-based proteins like beans, lentils, and tofu in your meals. Also, limit your intake of sodium, which can raise blood pressure and put extra strain on your kidneys. You can do this by avoiding processed foods and not adding extra salt to your meals. Lastly, stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. This helps your kidneys clear out toxins from your body. Does this information help?\n\nPatient: Yes. It did. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. If it's okay with you, I'd like to go over a few more topics to check on how you're doing. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: That's fine.\n\nNurse: Great. Since you have hypertension, it's important to monitor your blood pressure regularly. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was?\n\nPatient: I don't remember the readings, but it was this morning.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear that you're keeping track. It's essential to monitor your blood pressure daily given your condition. If you don't mind, could you share what the reading was this morning?\n\nPatient: Like I said, I don't recall the reading. But I do remember that I took it this morning.",
