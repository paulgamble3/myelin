        "our_model": "That's a great question. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is a measure of how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. A GFR of 101 mL/min/1.73m2, like yours, is within the normal range, indicating that your kidneys are functioning well. However, it's important to continue managing your health to keep your kidneys healthy. As for urine albumin, a level of 190 mg/g is a bit high. Albumin is a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. It's something your doctor will likely continue to monitor. Does this help clarify your results?"
