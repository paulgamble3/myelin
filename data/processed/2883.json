I'm glad to hear from you. I hope you're doing well. How are you feeling now that you're back home from the hospital?\n\nPatient: I'm okay, I think. Just a little scared about everything that's happened recently?\n\nNurse: I can imagine that it's been a lot to take in, Mr. Douglas. It's completely normal to feel a bit scared after a hospital stay. But remember, you're not alone in this. We're here to support you. Is there anything specific you're looking forward to doing now that you're back home?\n\nPatient: No. I'm just glad to be home. You know?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Douglas. There's no place like home. It's great to hear that you're back in your comfort zone. Do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy doing at home?\n\nPatient: I'm just, like, watching travel shows",
