Do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy doing at home?\n\nPatient: I'm just, like, watching travel shows\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful way to relax, Mr. Douglas. Travel shows can be so fascinating. Do you have a favorite destination or show that you particularly enjoy?\n\nPatient: Not really. I just kinda like seeing where people are going. You know?\n\nNurse: That's a great way to explore the world from the comfort of your own home, Mr. Douglas. It's like a virtual vacation.

Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Douglas. Let's start with your new medications.
