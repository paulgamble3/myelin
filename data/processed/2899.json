Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Douglas. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Douglas. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep an eye on these symptoms at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: Time.\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.",

Have they been able to contact you?",
