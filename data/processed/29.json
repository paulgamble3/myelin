        "gpt4": "Sure, I can help with that. A serving of Wishbone Italian dressing, which is about 2 tablespoons, contains approximately 370 milligrams of sodium or salt. Consuming too much sodium can raise blood pressure, so it's recommended to limit sodium intake to less than 2,300 milligrams a day. If it's okay with you, I can provide a few tips on how to reduce sodium in your meals.",
