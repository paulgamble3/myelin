        "gpt4": "Of course, I'd be glad to provide some information. It's important to monitor your protein intake due to PKU. Also, because of your CHF, you should also maintain a low-sodium diet and limit fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day. It might seem a bit overwhelming, but even small changes can make a big difference. Is it okay if I share some dietary recommendations with you?",
        "our_model": "Absolutely, Mr. Douglas. With PKU, it's important to limit foods high in protein. This includes meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, nuts, and seeds. Also, due to your CHF, it's recommended to follow a cardiac low sodium diet, a low protein diet, and a 1.5 Liters Fluid Restriction. Would it be okay if I share some dietary recommendations with you?"
