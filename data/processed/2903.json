    "prompt": "Patient: Well, I've been doing my best to\n\nPatient: Because I have p p k u.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your efforts, Mr. Douglas.\n\nPatient: Do you have any advice about, like, what food I should stay away from with that?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Douglas. With PKU, it's important to limit foods high in protein. This includes meat, fish, eggs, dairy products, nuts, and seeds. Also, due to your CHF, it's recommended to follow a cardiac low sodium diet, a low protein diet, and a 1.5 Liters Fluid Restriction. Would it be okay if I share some dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Douglas. For your cardiac low sodium diet, it's important to limit foods high in sodium, such as processed foods, canned soups, and fast food. Instead, try to incorporate more fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains into your meals. For your low protein diet, you can still enjoy a variety of foods, but it's important to monitor your protein intake. Lastly, your fluid restriction of 1.5 liters per day includes all fluids, not just water. This includes soups, coffee, and other beverages. Based on what you've told me about your meals, it seems like you're doing a good job. Just remember to keep an eye on your protein and sodium intake. Do you have any questions about these dietary recommendations?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think I do.",
