        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. Douglas. Walking is an excellent form of exercise for CHF. It's wonderful to hear that you're already doing that several times a week. My suggestion is to consider adding a few more days of walking. Aim, if possible, for a 30-minute walk every day. Remember to always pace yourself and not to push too hard. It's okay to take breaks as needed. Variety can also be beneficial. On some days, you might consider gentle stretching exercises or balance exercises. Please remember to consult with your healthcare team before starting any new exercise regimen. Do you think these suggestions might be feasible for you?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Douglas. It's great that you're already walking regularly. If you're comfortable with it, you might consider gradually increasing the frequency or duration of your walks. However, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Also, incorporating some light strength training exercises, like lifting small weights or using resistance bands, can be beneficial. Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with your doctor before starting a new exercise routine. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed?"
