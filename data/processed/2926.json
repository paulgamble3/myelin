    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent, thank you, Ms. McKloskey. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's what I'm planning on.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Ms. McKloskey. It's good to hear that the timing works well for you. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Okay. That sounds fine.\n\nNurse: Great, Ms. McKloskey. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Nope. Not at all.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. McKloskey. Let's move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
