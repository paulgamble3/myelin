Not at all.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. McKloskey. Let's move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. McKloskey. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol 500 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. McKloskey. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: I have. Are you there?",
