        "gpt4": "I understand, thank you for confirming this. The note about Oxycodone is pertaining to post-operative pain control and is not something you need to take now. It's for after the procedure, if necessary. Let's move on. Now, let's discuss your diet. Are there any changes you're making to your diet in preparation for the surgery?",
        "our_model": "I apologize for any confusion, Ms. McKloskey. To clarify, you're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed. This means you can take up to 1000 mg at a time, but you don't have to if you don't need to. The maximum you should take in a day is 3000 mg. Have you been taking the full 1000 mg each time?"
