        "gpt4": "Great. Oxycodone can effectively manage pain, but it can also cause constipation. It's a good idea to drink plenty of water and increase your fiber intake while taking it. If you feel severe constipation, please contact the clinic. The prescription is for 1-2 tablets every 4-6 hours as needed. Remember not to exceed the recommended maximum. Have you taken Oxycodone before, Ms. McKloskey?",
