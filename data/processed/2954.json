    "prompt": "Patient: How long will the procedure take?\n\nNurse: Give me a moment to check how I can best support you.\n\nNurse: Your total knee replacement procedure will typically take about 1 to 2 hours, Ms. McKloskey. This procedure involves removing the damaged parts of your knee joint and replacing them with artificial parts. It's a common procedure with a high success rate. Do you have any other questions about the procedure?\n\nPatient: How much pain do you think I'll be in after the surgery?\n\nNurse: Pain levels can vary greatly from person to person, Ms. McKloskey. However, it's important to know that after your procedure, you will be given pain medication to help manage any discomfort. This will be adjusted as needed to ensure you're as comfortable as possible. Does that help address your concern?\n\nPatient: Yes. And then how long before I start feeling better?\n\nNurse: Recovery times can also vary from person to person, Ms. McKloskey. Generally, you can expect to start feeling better and notice improvements in your mobility within a few weeks. However, it may take up to 3 months to fully recover and regain your strength. Remember, it's important to follow all post-operative instructions and not to rush your recovery. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes. That does. Thank you.",
