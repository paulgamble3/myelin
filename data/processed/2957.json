    "prompt": "Nurse: Recovery times can also vary from person to person, Ms. McKloskey. Generally, you can expect to start feeling better and notice improvements in your mobility within a few weeks. However, it may take up to 3 months to fully recover and regain your strength. Remember, it's important to follow all post-operative instructions and not to rush your recovery. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes. That does. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Ms. McKloskey. I'm glad I could provide the information you needed. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: No. You've answered all my questions. It's been really nice talking to you.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could assist you, Ms. McKloskey. It was nice talking to you as well. Before we end the call, let's summarize what you still need to do before your procedure. You need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. You also need to remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: I'm planning on it.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. McKloskey. Remember, we're here for you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns at any time, don't hesitate to call us back at 641-381-6523. [\n\nPatient: Okay. I've got it. Thank you.",
