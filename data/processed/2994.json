    "prompt": "Nurse: That's excellent. You're doing a great job managing your new medication. Now, let's briefly discuss your existing medications. Are you still taking Captopril, Carvedilol, and Metformin?\n\nPatient: I sure am.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to continue taking these medications as prescribed. I understand that managing multiple medications can sometimes be challenging. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time?\n\nPatient: No. I take everything I'm supposed to take it. I'm still having these symptoms, and it is really getting worrisome.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're still experiencing symptoms despite taking your medications. It's critical to understand these symptoms to manage your CHF. Would it be okay if I ask you a few more questions about your symptoms?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you. You mentioned earlier that you've been experiencing shortness of breath. Is this happening with activity, when you're laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: It seems like all the time.",
