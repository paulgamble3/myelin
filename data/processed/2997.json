    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you. You mentioned earlier that you've been experiencing shortness of breath. Is this happening with activity, when you're laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: It seems like all the time.\n\nNurse: I see. It's essential to note that. Have you been experiencing any ongoing or worsening chest pain?\n\nPatient: No. No. No chest pain, thankfully.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, you mentioned a dry cough earlier. Is this new or has it been ongoing?\n\nPatient: This is new since the hospital. I had a cost that was with me before the hospital. Now it's come back again.\n\nNurse: I see, a new or worsening dry cough can be a sign of fluid buildup in the lungs. It's essential to monitor this closely. Now, you mentioned earlier that you've gained weight. Have you noticed any increased swelling in your feet, ankles, stomach, or legs?\n\nPatient: No. I think you asked me about that, and I said, thankfully, that hasn't started yet. Just the weight gain.",
