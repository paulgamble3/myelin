    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to keep an eye out for any swelling. Now, you mentioned earlier that you've gained weight. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: Yes. I told you I gained two pounds in the last day.\n\nNurse: I see, that's a significant weight gain in a short period. It's critical to monitor this closely. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't been doing that.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Using more pillows can sometimes be a sign of fluid buildup in the lungs. We've just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to do this at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: I just hope I can remember these questions. I'm really, really frustrated, and I'm upset. And it's hard to concentrate trade on anything except for the fact that I'm gonna wind up back in the hospital again.\n\nNurse: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's completely normal to feel frustrated and worried, especially after a recent hospital stay. It's critical to remember that these symptoms are signs that your body is trying to tell you something. By monitoring them and sharing this information with your healthcare team, we can work together to manage your CHF. Now, let's talk about your diet. Can you tell me about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: Well, yeah. I know I'm supposed to be watching the salt in the fluid intake, and I have been doing that for the most part. I'm not eating processed foods. I'm eating fresh foods. Fresh fruits, fresh vegetables. I'm trying to be careful, but it seems like it's just not working.",

        "gpt4": "It sounds like you're doing an excellent job with your diet, especially with choosing fresh foods over processed ones which can be high in salt. Do you mind if I review your dietary recommendations with you?",
        "our_model": "It sounds like you're making a good effort to eat healthily, which is great. Fresh fruits and vegetables are excellent choices. However, it's also important to be mindful of the fluid intake. You're on a 2 Liter Fluid restriction. This includes all fluids, not just water. Can you tell me more about your fluid intake?"
