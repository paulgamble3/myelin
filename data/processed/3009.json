However, there are gentle exercises that can be beneficial for managing CHF. Would it be okay if I share some recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: I guess so.\n\nNurse: Thank you. Gentle exercises like walking or chair exercises can be beneficial. It's important to start slow and gradually increase your activity level as your symptoms improve.
