    "prompt": "Nurse: I can imagine that it's a lot to think about. It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious before a procedure. How are you feeling about the colonoscopy specifically?\n\nPatient: That's what I'm referring to. I'm a bit nervous about that. I I fear something will go wrong.\n\nNurse: It's completely normal to feel nervous. Your gastroenterologist, Doctor Meredith Bailey, is highly experienced and has performed over 1500 colonoscopies. She's known for her excellent care. This procedure is a preventative screening for colon cancer, and it's a great step you're taking to take care of your health. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: Well, what happens if it causes bleeding?\n\nNurse: That's a very valid concern. Bleeding can occur in some cases, but it's usually minor and stops on its own. In rare cases, if there's significant bleeding, your doctor might need to treat it. But please remember, these are rare cases. I'll make a note of your concern for your care team to review. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy now?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: Hello. I'm here to help you prepare for your colonoscopy. I'll be going over some important points. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect. Today, we will ensure that you have everything you need for your colonoscopy, and I will call you again the day before your procedure to check in. May I continue with the next topic on our list?",
        "our_model": "Great. The preparation for a colonoscopy is crucial. You'll need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before your procedure. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. You should avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. You'll also need to take a bowel prep solution, which will help clean out your colon. This is a crucial step as a clean colon allows for a more accurate procedure. Do you have any questions about this?"
