    "prompt": "Nurse: It's completely normal to feel nervous. Your gastroenterologist, Doctor Meredith Bailey, is highly experienced and has performed over 1500 colonoscopies. She's known for her excellent care. This procedure is a preventative screening for colon cancer, and it's a great step you're taking to take care of your health. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: Well, what happens if it causes bleeding?\n\nNurse: That's a very valid concern. Bleeding can occur in some cases, but it's usually minor and stops on its own. In rare cases, if there's significant bleeding, your doctor might need to treat it. But please remember, these are rare cases. I'll make a note of your concern for your care team to review. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy now?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: Hello. I'm here to help you prepare for your colonoscopy. I'll be going over some important points. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great. The preparation for a colonoscopy is crucial. You'll need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before your procedure. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. You should avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. You'll also need to take a bowel prep solution, which will help clean out your colon. This is a crucial step as a clean colon allows for a more accurate procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Alright. I see on our records that you're currently taking Ferrous Sulfate 200 mg, once a day. With your colonoscopy coming up, it is important that you stop taking the iron supplement a few days before the procedure as it could potentially darken the view during the examination. I will note this down for your care team to confirm. However, you should not make any changes to your medication without discussing it with your doctor. I am here to guide you and ensure you have everything you need. Do you have any questions related to this or is it okay if I move on to the logistics of the colonoscopy appointment?",
        "our_model": "Alright, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you?"
