    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a very valid concern. Bleeding can occur in some cases, but it's usually minor and stops on its own. In rare cases, if there's significant bleeding, your doctor might need to treat it. But please remember, these are rare cases. I'll make a note of your concern for your care team to review. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy now?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: Hello. I'm here to help you prepare for your colonoscopy. I'll be going over some important points. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great. The preparation for a colonoscopy is crucial. You'll need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before your procedure. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. You should avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. You'll also need to take a bowel prep solution, which will help clean out your colon. This is a crucial step as a clean colon allows for a more accurate procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
