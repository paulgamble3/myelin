    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Okay. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm glad we could go over the logistics. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to move forward?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great. I see on your chart that you take Ferrous Sulfate 200mg once a day. You will need to stop this medication 5 days before your procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?",
