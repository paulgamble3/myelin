    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm glad we could go over the logistics. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to move forward?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Ferrous Sulfate 200 mg once a day. For your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking this medication 5 days prior to the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Do you have any questions about stopping this medication?\n\nPatient: No.",
