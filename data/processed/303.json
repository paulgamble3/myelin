    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand your concern. The urine albumin test is an important part of managing your kidney disease. It helps us monitor how your kidneys are functioning. Would it be okay if I explain this in more detail?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Tell me why I have to pee in the cup.\n\nNurse: Certainly. The urine albumin test measures the amount of albumin in your urine. Albumin is a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. Your doctor uses this test to monitor your kidney function and to detect any early signs of kidney disease. It's a routine test for patients with chronic kidney disease like yourself. Does that help clarify things a bit?\n\nPatient: I mean, I guess. I still don't understand why I need to pay for it, but whatever. I have another question.\n\nNurse: Of course. I'm here to help answer any questions you have. What's your next question?\n\nPatient: What? What qualifies as a high blood sugar?\n\nNurse: That's a great question. A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL is considered normal. A reading of more than 200 mg/dL after two hours indicates diabetes. A reading between 140 and 199 mg/dL indicates prediabetes. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: A great question.",
