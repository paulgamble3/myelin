    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. Let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This includes foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and avoiding foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: I love white rice.\n\nNurse: White rice is a great choice for a low fiber diet. It's easy to digest and will help prepare your colon for the procedure. Do you usually prepare it in a specific way?\n\nPatient: I'll usually add some Seaweed to it.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a tasty way to prepare it. Just remember, for the preparation of your colonoscopy, it's best to keep the dish as simple as possible. This means avoiding any additional ingredients that might be high in fiber. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other comfort foods you're considering?\n\nPatient: No.",
