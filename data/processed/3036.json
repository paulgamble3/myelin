    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, this is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. It's all part of the preparation for your colonoscopy. Now, let's move on to discuss supplements. You'll need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to avoid these as they can interfere with the preparation for your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Sorry.\n\nNurse: No problem at all. I was asking about how you're feeling about the clear liquid diet and the NuLYTELY laxative solution. It's often considered the most challenging part of the preparation. Do you have any concerns about this?\n\nPatient: I said fine.",

        "our_model": "I see, thank you for confirming. It's completely normal to feel a bit apprehensive about this part of the preparation. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?"
