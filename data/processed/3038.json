I am can Be scared?\n\nNurse: It's completely normal to feel scared. The bowel prep can be a bit uncomfortable, but it's a crucial part of ensuring that your colonoscopy goes smoothly. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
