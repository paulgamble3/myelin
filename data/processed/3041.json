    "prompt": "Nurse: It's completely normal to feel scared. The bowel prep can be a bit uncomfortable, but it's a crucial part of ensuring that your colonoscopy goes smoothly. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's critical to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about these diet changes?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Here are a couple of tips that might help. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it easier to drink. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: That's fine, I guess.",
