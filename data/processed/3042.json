    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's critical to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about these diet changes?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Here are a couple of tips that might help. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it easier to drink. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: That's fine, I guess.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you find these tips helpful. Remember, the goal is to make the bowel prep as comfortable as possible for you. Do you have any other questions about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: No.",

You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Is there anything you would like to know about this?",
