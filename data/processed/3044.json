    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent. Here are a couple of tips that might help. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it easier to drink. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: That's fine, I guess.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you find these tips helpful. Remember, the goal is to make the bowel prep as comfortable as possible for you. Do you have any other questions about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. The last part of your prep is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we move on, do you have any questions about anything we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: See, you're sure the doctor is not gonna accidentally punch or something.",
