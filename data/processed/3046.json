    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. The last part of your prep is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we move on, do you have any questions about anything we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: See, you're sure the doctor is not gonna accidentally punch or something.\n\nNurse: I can understand your concern. Rest assured, Doctor Bailey is highly skilled and experienced. She has performed over 1500 colonoscopies without any such incidents. The procedure is designed to be safe and comfortable for you. I'll make a note of your concern for your care team to review. Now, I have a couple more questions for you. Are you currently experiencing any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for the last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Wonderful, having someone you trust to drive you home after the procedure is very important since you'll be under the effects of sedation. That concludes all the topics for today. Before I summarize, do you have any other questions or concerns?",
        "our_model": "That's great to hear. It's critical to have someone available to take you home after the procedure as you may still be feeling the effects of the sedation. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any other questions you have, feel free to ask."
