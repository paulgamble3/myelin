    "prompt": "Nurse: I can understand your concern. Rest assured, Doctor Bailey is highly skilled and experienced. She has performed over 1500 colonoscopies without any such incidents. The procedure is designed to be safe and comfortable for you. I'll make a note of your concern for your care team to review. Now, I have a couple more questions for you. Are you currently experiencing any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for the last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's critical to have someone available to take you home after the procedure as you may still be feeling the effects of the sedation. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any other questions you have, feel free to ask.\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Alright then. I'd like to summarize what we've discussed. Your colonoscopy with Dr. Meredith Bailey is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM. You should arrive at the hospital an hour early. For the procedure prep, you'll stop taking Ferrous Sulfate five days before the procedure, start a low fiber diet and drink the NuLYTELY laxative solution as instructed. We've also discussed the importance of following a clear liquid diet a day before the procedure, and to stop all intake 4 hours before your procedure. You've also confirmed that you will have a ride home after your procedure. Does that cover everything we discussed?",
