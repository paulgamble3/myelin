    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. It's critical to have someone available to take you home after the procedure as you may still be feeling the effects of the sedation. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any other questions you have, feel free to ask.\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Excellent. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over the logistics, your medication, diet preparation, and the bowel prep. You've confirmed that you're not currently experiencing any signs of illness and that you've arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. I want to remind you that we're here for you every step of the way. I will call you again the day before the procedure to go over step by step all the prep instructions. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, you can reach us at 641-381-6523.\n\nPatient: Okay.",
