    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great question. A blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL is considered normal. A reading of more than 200 mg/dL after two hours indicates diabetes. A reading between 140 and 199 mg/dL indicates prediabetes. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: A great question.\n\nNurse: In general, a blood sugar level less than 140 mg/dL is considered normal. A reading of more than 200 mg/dL after two hours indicates diabetes. A reading between 140 and 199 mg/dL indicates prediabetes. Have you been checking your blood sugar levels daily?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Could you share with me what your last blood sugar reading was?\n\nPatient: One twenty.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. A reading of 120 mg/dL is slightly elevated. It's essential to keep an eye on this. Would it be okay if I share some recommendations on how to manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: No. You just told me if it's less than one forty, it's normal.",

        "gpt4": "You're absolutely correct, Damian. My apologies for the confusion. A blood sugar level of 120 mg/dL is within the normal range. Since you're already doing a great job monitoring your blood sugar, let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you checked it and what were the results?",
        "our_model": "You're correct. A blood sugar level of 120 mg/dL is slightly above the normal range, but it's not too high. However, it's important to monitor it regularly to ensure it doesn't increase. Can we discuss your blood pressure next?"
