Before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, I wanted to ask if there are any symptoms or health concerns you've been experiencing lately that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I do have a question about\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Hardy. Please feel free to ask your question.\n\nPatient: what dietary changes I need to make. To preserve my kidney function. Keeping in mind, I am on the dash diet.\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Hardy. The DASH diet is already a good start as it emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. However, for kidney health, it's also important to limit sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. Would you like me to provide some recommendations on how to adjust your diet to better support your kidney health?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Hardy. One of the key dietary changes for kidney health is to limit your sodium intake. This means avoiding processed foods and adding less salt to your meals. Instead, you can use herbs and spices for flavor. Another important change is to limit high-potassium foods like bananas, oranges, and potatoes. Lastly, it's recommended to limit foods high in phosphorus, such as dairy products and certain types of fish. However, it's important to remember that everyone's dietary needs are unique, and these are general guidelines. It's always best to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized advice. Does that help answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Thank you.",
