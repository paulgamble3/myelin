    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Hardy. One of the key dietary changes for kidney health is to limit your sodium intake. This means avoiding processed foods and adding less salt to your meals. Instead, you can use herbs and spices for flavor. Another important change is to limit high-potassium foods like bananas, oranges, and potatoes. Lastly, it's recommended to limit foods high in phosphorus, such as dairy products and certain types of fish. However, it's important to remember that everyone's dietary needs are unique, and these are general guidelines. It's always best to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized advice. Does that help answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Hardy. I'm glad I could help. If it's okay with you, I'd like to go over a few more topics to check on how you're doing. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Hardy. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Hardy. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: A hundred and forty eight.",
