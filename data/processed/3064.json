    "prompt": "Nurse: You're welcome, Mr. Hardy. I'm glad I could help. If it's okay with you, I'd like to go over a few more topics to check on how you're doing. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Hardy. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Hardy. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: A hundred and forty eight.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Hardy. A blood sugar level of 148 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes. Would it be alright if I provide some recommendations on how to manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

This could be anything from a walk around the block to gentle yoga. Moreover, make sure to take your medicines like Insulin Lantus and Aspart as prescribed by your doctor. And keep checking your blood sugar regularly and record the numbers so your doctor can help you manage your condition. Do you feel you can put these suggestions into practice, Mr. Hardy?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Hardy. One strategy to help manage your blood sugar levels is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, and incorporating a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. It's also important to limit foods high in sugar. Another strategy is regular physical activity. Even a short walk after meals can help lower your blood sugar levels. Lastly, taking your prescribed medications as directed by your doctor is crucial. Do these suggestions make sense to you, Mr. Hardy?"
