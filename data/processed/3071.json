    "prompt": "Nurse: Mr. Hardy, are you still there?\n\nPatient: Yes. And I said, yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Hardy. To maintain a healthy blood pressure, it's beneficial to follow a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins, similar to the DASH diet you're already following. It's also important to limit sodium intake, as high sodium can raise blood pressure. Regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, can also help lower blood pressure. Lastly, managing stress through relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation can be helpful. Do these suggestions sound manageable to you, Mr. Hardy?\n\nPatient: Yes. It's always something I need to work on.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Hardy. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is indeed a continuous process. It's great that you're committed to it. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: I am\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Hardy.

        "gpt4": "Absolutely, Mr. Hardy. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate, which measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. It's an important test for assessing kidney health.\n\nUrine Albumin measures the amount of albumin, a type of protein, in your urine. High levels of urine albumin may indicate kidney damage, as healthy kidneys typically don't allow a significant amount of protein to pass through their filters.\n\nWould you like more information on what normal levels for these tests are, or do you have any other questions about them?",
        "our_model": "Of course, Mr. Hardy. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. Urine Albumin refers to the amount of a protein called albumin in your urine. A high level of albumin can indicate kidney damage. Does that help clarify those terms for you, Mr. Hardy?"
