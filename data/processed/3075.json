Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. Urine Albumin refers to the amount of a protein called albumin in your urine. A high level of albumin can indicate kidney damage. Does that help clarify those terms for you, Mr. Hardy?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Boy, you are full of good information.
