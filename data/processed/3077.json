Are you currently taking it as prescribed, Mr. Hardy?\n\nPatient: Well, I forgot how many I was supposed to take a day, so I've only been taking one.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Hardy. It's quite common to forget the dosage of medications. Would it be alright if I provide some suggestions on how to remember to take your medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Okay.",

This can help ensure that you take the correct doses each day.\n\n2. Set Reminders: You can set reminders on your phone or alarm clock to take your medication at the same times every day.\n\n3. Link it With a Routine: Try taking your medication at the same time as a daily routine, like brushing your teeth or having meals.\n\nI hope these suggestions will be helpful for you, Mr. Hardy. Also, it's crucial to take your apixaban twice a day, as directed by your doctor. Taking the right dosage of this medication helps prevent blood clots from forming, which is especially important considering your condition. Please start taking it as prescribed, and remember to consult your doctor if you have any concerns or side effects. Does that all make sense?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Hardy. One strategy could be setting reminders on your phone or a clock. Another could be using a pillbox with compartments for each day of the week. It's also a good idea to keep your medications in a place where you'll see them every day, like next to your toothbrush. Lastly, it's important to talk to your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen. Does that sound helpful, Mr. Hardy?"
