    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Hardy, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: Yes. Do I need to just take one tablet a day of my prescription called apixaban.\n\nNurse: According to your medication list, you should be taking Apixaban 5 mg two times a day, not just once. This medication is important for preventing blood clots, especially with your condition of Atrial Fibrillation. Are you currently taking it as prescribed, Mr. Hardy?\n\nPatient: Well, I forgot how many I was supposed to take a day, so I've only been taking one.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Hardy. It's quite common to forget the dosage of medications. Would it be alright if I provide some suggestions on how to remember to take your medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Hardy. One strategy could be setting reminders on your phone or a clock. Another could be using a pillbox with compartments for each day of the week. It's also a good idea to keep your medications in a place where you'll see them every day, like next to your toothbrush. Lastly, it's important to talk to your doctor before making any changes to your medication regimen. Does that sound helpful, Mr. Hardy?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That is helpful.",

        "gpt4": "I'm happy to hear that you found the suggestions helpful, Mr. Hardy. Now, just as a gentle reminder, there are certain medications and supplements that might not be safe for you to take because of your chronic kidney disease. It's important to consult with Doctor Gopal or a pharmacist before starting any new medication, even if they are over-the-counter. Do you have any questions about that, Mr. Hardy?",
        "our_model": "I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Hardy. Now, let's discuss your other medications. You're also prescribed Lisinopril 5 mg daily, Insulin Lantus 10 units every night at bedtime, and Aspart 3 units three times a day. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?"
