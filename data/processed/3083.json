        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Hardy. Since you have chronic kidney disease, I would suggest limiting your intake of high potassium fruits. Instead, you might consider fruits like apples, berries, or peaches, which are lower in potassium. Additionally, for your stir-fries and salads, use a variety of colorful veggies and lean protein like chicken or tofu to ensure you're getting a good balance of nutrients, but be careful with the amount of soy sauce or other high-sodium sauces you use as they can increase your sodium intake. Lastly, yogurt is a good source of protein, but it's also high in phosphorus, so it would be advisable to have it in moderation. Remember, though, these are general recommendations and your diet should match your personal needs. Is all this making sense, Mr. Hardy?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Hardy. Since you're already eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, one suggestion could be to include more lean proteins in your meals."
