Incorporating lean proteins, such as chicken, turkey or fish, into your meals can help maintain a healthy diet and manage your blood sugar levels. Whole grains such as brown rice, oatmeal, or whole wheat bread are also good options. Remember to control portions and limit high sodium foods. Keep doing the great job you're doing with your regular consumption of fruits and vegetables.",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Hardy. Since you're already eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, one suggestion could be to include more high-fiber foods in your diet. These include whole grains, legumes, and nuts. They can help control your blood sugar levels and lower your cholesterol. Another suggestion is to limit your intake of processed foods, as they often contain high amounts of sodium. Lastly, try to include lean proteins like fish, poultry, or beans in your meals. These are all general guidelines, and it's always best to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized advice. Does that sound manageable to you, Mr. Hardy?"
