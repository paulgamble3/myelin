    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Hardy, could you please repeat the last part of your meal description?\n\nPatient: salads.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a very healthy diet, Mr. Hardy. Stir-fries, salads, and fruits with yogurt are all excellent choices. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some suggestions to further optimize your diet. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Hardy. Since you're already eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, one suggestion could be to include more lean proteins in your meals.\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Hardy. Since you're already eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, one suggestion could be to include more high-fiber foods in your diet. These include whole grains, legumes, and nuts. They can help control your blood sugar levels and lower your cholesterol. Another suggestion is to limit your intake of processed foods, as they often contain high amounts of sodium. Lastly, try to include lean proteins like fish, poultry, or beans in your meals. These are all general guidelines, and it's always best to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized advice. Does that sound manageable to you, Mr. Hardy?\n\nPatient: Why? Yes. It does.",
