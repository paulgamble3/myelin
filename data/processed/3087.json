    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Hardy. Since you're already eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, one suggestion could be to include more lean proteins in your meals.\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Hardy. Since you're already eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, one suggestion could be to include more high-fiber foods in your diet. These include whole grains, legumes, and nuts. They can help control your blood sugar levels and lower your cholesterol. Another suggestion is to limit your intake of processed foods, as they often contain high amounts of sodium. Lastly, try to include lean proteins like fish, poultry, or beans in your meals. These are all general guidelines, and it's always best to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized advice. Does that sound manageable to you, Mr. Hardy?\n\nPatient: Why? Yes. It does.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Hardy. Now, let's discuss your Atrial Fibrillation. Have you been experiencing any symptoms such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, or fatigue?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Hardy. It's critical to keep an eye on any symptoms and report them to your doctor. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices?\n\nPatient: I do not.",
