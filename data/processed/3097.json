    "prompt": "Nurse: President Lincoln, that's quite a name! He must have been thrilled to have you back home. Now, I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Phil Steele to discuss a few topics related to your health. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to your medications. I see that you don't have any new prescriptions, but I'd like to confirm that you're still taking your existing medications. Are you still taking Bumex and Captopril?\n\nPatient: Yes. I am.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to keep up with your medications. Now, I understand that sometimes it can be challenging to remember to take medications on time. Do you ever have trouble with this?\n\nPatient: I guess maybe every once in a while.\n\nNurse: It's quite common to miss a dose here or there. Would it be alright if I shared some suggestions on how to manage this?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sure.",

        "gpt4": "One approach could be setting reminders on your phone or mark it on a calendar when you take your medication. Also, keeping your medication in a place where you're likely to see it often can be helpful. This may make it easier to remember to take your medication at the prescribed times. Do you think these methods might be useful in your situation?\n\n",
        "our_model": "Okay. One method that many people find helpful is setting reminders on their phone or using a pillbox with compartments for each day of the week. This can help ensure you're taking your medications as prescribed. Now, with your permission, I'd like to ask a few questions about your symptoms to understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?"
