    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Took it\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Damian, your response got cut off.\n\nPatient: today, and it was\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, you were saying?\n\nPatient: ninety over one twenty.\n\nNurse: Thank you for that information. A blood pressure reading of 90 over 120 is within the acceptable range, but the lower number is a bit high. It's important to keep monitoring it. Would it be okay if I share some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: No. It wouldn't be okay.",
