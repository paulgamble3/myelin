    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: I just eat whatever easy. So, like, go out of microwave stuff.\n\nNurse: I see. Convenience is important, especially when you're not feeling your best. Can you share a bit more about what types of microwave meals you typically have?\n\nPatient: They're just, like, rice mostly, I guess.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. Rice can be a part of a balanced diet. Now, I'd like to remind you of your dietary recommendations. You're on a fluid restriction of 1.5 liters per day. This includes all fluids, not just water. Are you okay with me sharing some tips on how to manage this?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent. One method is to measure out the 1.5 liters of fluid at the start of the day and drink from that. This can help you keep track of your fluid intake. Now, let's talk about your sodium restriction. You're on a 1500 mg sodium restricted diet. This means avoiding high-sodium foods like processed meats, canned soups, and fast food. Would it be alright if I shared some low-sodium meal ideas with you?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great! Instead of pre-packaged meals, which can be high in sodium, consider meals like grilled chicken with a side of vegetables, or homemade vegetable soup. There are a lot of low-sodium recipes available online as well. Do you have any questions or concerns about your diet that you'd like to discuss?",
        "our_model": "Great. For breakfast, you could have oatmeal with fresh fruit and a sprinkle of cinnamon. For lunch, a salad with grilled chicken, a variety of vegetables, and a low-sodium dressing could be a good option. For dinner, you could have steamed fish with a side of rice and steamed vegetables. Snacks could include fresh fruits or unsalted nuts. Remember, it's important to read food labels to check the sodium content. Now, based on what you've shared about your regular diet, I understand that you're currently eating mostly microwave meals. It's okay to have these occasionally, but try to incorporate more fresh foods and the meal ideas I shared into your diet. It's also important to limit your fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day. Do you have any questions or concerns about these dietary recommendations?"
