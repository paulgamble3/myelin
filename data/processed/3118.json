    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you. Gentle exercises like walking or light stretching can be beneficial. Even a short walk around your home can make a difference. It's essential to start slow and gradually increase your activity level as your strength improves. Remember, it's always best to listen to your body and rest if you need to. Do you have any questions or concerns about these exercise recommendations?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I understand that adjusting diet and exercise can be challenging. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'll be sure to inform Doctor Steele about our conversation and how you're doing. Before we end the call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Do you think I'm Okay. I really, really don't feel good.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're not feeling well. It's important to take your symptoms seriously. I would recommend that you contact your primary care doctor, Doctor Steele, right away to discuss your symptoms. They may want to adjust your treatment plan or have you come in for a visit. Can I assist you with setting up an appointment?\n\nPatient: Okay.",
