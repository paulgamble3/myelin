        "gpt4": "Perfect, Mr. Valenzuela. Let's move onto the medications. I see on your chart that you don't have any specific medication change for this procedure. Just to double-check, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners? These types of medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise.",
