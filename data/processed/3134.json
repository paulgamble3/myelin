For example, is there anything about the day of the procedure that you're unsure about or concerned about?\n\nPatient: No. Not yet.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. If any concerns come up, don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to continue?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your medication.
