Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I don't. But I do have diarrhea.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to note that the diarrhea you're experiencing is likely due to the bowel prep for the colonoscopy, not the procedure itself. This is a normal part of the process. Do you have any questions about this or any other aspects of the preparation?\n\nPatient: I haven't started my laxative yet.\n\nNurse: That's correct, Mr. Valenzuela.

How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Again, I'm, like, ready to get over with and\n\nNurse: I hear you, Mr. Valenzuela. It's a tough part, but it's crucial for the success of the procedure.

This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are?"
