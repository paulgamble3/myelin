Do you have any questions about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. You don't have to do anything just yet.

You can also have jello or other gelatin, but make sure it doesn't contain any fruit or red color. Does that help clarify things for you? Do you have any questions about this clear liquid diet?",
