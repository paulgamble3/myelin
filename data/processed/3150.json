    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. It's essential to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of clear liquids. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: No. I it's all temporary, so I think I'm gonna be okay.\n\nNurse: That's the right attitude, Mr. Valenzuela. It's indeed temporary and a crucial part of the procedure. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Yes. What are the tips?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. Here are a couple of tips that might make the bowel prep easier for you. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it more palatable. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: I will try them. That's what I think.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. Trying different strategies can often make the process more manageable. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or any other aspects of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",
