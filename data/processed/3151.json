    "prompt": "Nurse: That's the right attitude, Mr. Valenzuela. It's indeed temporary and a crucial part of the procedure. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Yes. What are the tips?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. Here are a couple of tips that might make the bowel prep easier for you. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it more palatable. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: I will try them. That's what I think.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. Trying different strategies can often make the process more manageable. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or any other aspects of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to remember that some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. Now, let's transition to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: So I cannot even have a water",
