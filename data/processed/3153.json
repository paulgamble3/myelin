    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. Trying different strategies can often make the process more manageable. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or any other aspects of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to remember that some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. Now, let's transition to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: So I cannot even have a water\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Valenzuela. You're correct. You should not have anything to eat or drink, including water, 4 hours before your procedure. This is to ensure your stomach and intestines are completely empty for the procedure. Do you have any other questions about this or any other aspects of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Oh, well,\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Valenzuela.\n\nPatient: I hope I'm not gonna be dehydrated.",

        "gpt4": "That's a valid concern, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to drink lots of clear fluids the day before your procedure to make sure you stay hydrated before your fasting period begins. Your care team at the hospital will also ensure that you are hydrated during your visit. Do you feel reassured about this or do you still have any questions?",
        "our_model": "That's a valid concern, Mr. Valenzuela. It's critical to stay hydrated, especially during the bowel prep. However, the 4-hour fasting period before the procedure is crucial for the success of the colonoscopy. Your care team will monitor you closely during the procedure to ensure your well-being. Do you have any other questions or concerns?"
