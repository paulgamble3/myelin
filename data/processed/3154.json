    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. It's important to remember that some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. Now, let's transition to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: So I cannot even have a water\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Valenzuela. You're correct. You should not have anything to eat or drink, including water, 4 hours before your procedure. This is to ensure your stomach and intestines are completely empty for the procedure. Do you have any other questions about this or any other aspects of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Oh, well,\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Valenzuela.\n\nPatient: I hope I'm not gonna be dehydrated.\n\nNurse: That's a valid concern, Mr. Valenzuela. It's critical to stay hydrated, especially during the bowel prep. However, the 4-hour fasting period before the procedure is crucial for the success of the colonoscopy. Your care team will monitor you closely during the procedure to ensure your well-being. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: Alright. No. Thank you so much. This is extremely helpful.",
