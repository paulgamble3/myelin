    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Mr. Valenzuela. You're correct. You should not have anything to eat or drink, including water, 4 hours before your procedure. This is to ensure your stomach and intestines are completely empty for the procedure. Do you have any other questions about this or any other aspects of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Oh, well,\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Valenzuela.\n\nPatient: I hope I'm not gonna be dehydrated.\n\nNurse: That's a valid concern, Mr. Valenzuela. It's critical to stay hydrated, especially during the bowel prep. However, the 4-hour fasting period before the procedure is crucial for the success of the colonoscopy. Your care team will monitor you closely during the procedure to ensure your well-being. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: Alright. No. Thank you so much. This is extremely helpful.\n\nNurse: You're very welcome, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad I could assist. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I do not have any questions.",
