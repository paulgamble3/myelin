Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: Alright. No. Thank you so much. This is extremely helpful.\n\nNurse: You're very welcome, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad I could assist. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I do not have any questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I appreciate your patience. My next question is about your current health status. Have you been experiencing any signs of illness recently, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Valenzuela.
