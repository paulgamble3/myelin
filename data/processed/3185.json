    "prompt": "Nurse: While there are many claims out there about arthritis cures, it's important to remember that everyone's experience with arthritis is unique. The best approach is often a combination of medical treatment and lifestyle changes. Your upcoming knee replacement is a significant step in managing your arthritis. It's always a good idea to discuss any new treatments or changes with your doctor. Would you like me to note down your question about these arthritis cures for Doctor Stevens to address during your next visit?\n\nPatient: Yeah, please.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, I'll make a note of that for Doctor Stevens. Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to review a few topics to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Right knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Perfect.",
