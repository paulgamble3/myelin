Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to review a few topics to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Right knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Perfect.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. Not particularly.",
