Now, I'd like to ask if you've arranged for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's essential to have someone around to help you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any questions you have, feel free to ask. [\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]",
