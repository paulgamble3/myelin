You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yeah. My daughter's gonna pick me up and take me home.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's important to have someone to assist you after the procedure. Now, I'd like to ask if you've arranged for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's essential to have someone around to help you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any questions you have, feel free to ask. [\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: Alright, if there are no further questions, I believe we've covered all the necessary topics for today. Before we end the call, do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad we covered everything you need for the upcoming procedure. Just to summarize, you'll be using a chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of the surgery. You should not eat or drink anything after midnight before the surgery. And you made arrangements to be picked up and have someone stay with you after the surgery. Can we count on you to do all of this?",
