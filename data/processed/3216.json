Rain can be quite relaxing though, don't you think?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: I'm glad you see it that way. I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Sarah Forbes today, and I have a few topics to cover with you. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to your medications then. Are you still taking your Lasix and Lisinopril as prescribed by Doctor Forbes?\n\nPatient: Yes. I am.",
