Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to your medications then. Are you still taking your Lasix and Lisinopril as prescribed by Doctor Forbes?\n\nPatient: Yes. I am.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. And how about Gabapentin?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
