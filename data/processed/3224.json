Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: That's fantastic. You're doing a great job. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Have you experienced any ongoing or worsening chest pain?\n\nPatient: No.",
