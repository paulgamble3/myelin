    "prompt": "Nurse: I see. Can you tell me how much weight you've gained?\n\nPatient: Which makes me really upset.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling upset about weight gain. It's a common concern, especially with CHF. Can you tell me how much weight you've gained?\n\nPatient: Yeah. On typically, one ninety two, and I just waived myself yesterday, and I'm one ninety four. And four pounds.\n\nNurse: I see, a weight increase of two pounds in a day can be a sign of fluid retention, which is something we need to monitor closely with CHF. Have you noticed any increased swelling in your feet, ankles, stomach, or legs?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.",
