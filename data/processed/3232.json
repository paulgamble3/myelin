    "prompt": "Nurse: I see, a weight increase of two pounds in a day can be a sign of fluid retention, which is something we need to monitor closely with CHF. Have you noticed any increased swelling in your feet, ankles, stomach, or legs?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to do this at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, I'd like to talk about your diet. Can you tell me about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been eating whatever I want. I haven't been following the fluid restricted and called restricted diet. To be honest with you.",
