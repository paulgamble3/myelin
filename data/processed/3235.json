    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. Now, I'd like to talk about your diet. Can you tell me about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: Well, I've been eating whatever I want. I haven't been following the fluid restricted and called restricted diet. To be honest with you.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your honesty. It's not always easy to make dietary changes. Can you share a bit more about what you've been eating recently?\n\nPatient: Just whatever I want. I had a burger\n\nNurse: I see. And what did you have with your burger?\n\nPatient: and I had a milkshake.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's important to enjoy what we eat. If it's okay with you, I'd like to share some dietary recommendations that could help manage your CHF. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's fine.",
