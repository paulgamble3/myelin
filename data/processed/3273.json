Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please confirm what you just said?\n\nPatient: I said no.\n\nNurse: I appreciate you letting me know. Give me a moment to check how I can best help you. Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. Thank you for confirming, Patient. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep track of these symptoms at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be a bit complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: I'm on a low fodmap diet.",
