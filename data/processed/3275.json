Thank you for confirming, Patient. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep track of these symptoms at home every day.

Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: I'm on a low fodmap diet.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Patient. Could you share a bit more about what you typically eat in a day?\n\nPatient: What food can I eat?\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. Give me a moment to check how I can best support you.",
