    "prompt": "Patient: What food can I eat?\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. Give me a moment to check how I can best support you.\n\nNurse: I see that you're on a low FODMAP diet. This diet is designed to help manage digestive symptoms. It involves limiting certain types of carbohydrates that can be difficult to digest. Some foods that are generally allowed on this diet include meats, fish, eggs, certain fruits and vegetables, and certain grains like rice and oats. However, it's important to remember that everyone's tolerance to these foods can be different. Would you like me to share some specific food recommendations that align with your dietary needs?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.\n\nNurse: Great, let's start with proteins. You can have meats like chicken, turkey, and beef, as well as fish and eggs. For fruits, you can have bananas, blueberries, and strawberries. For vegetables, you can have carrots, bell peppers, and spinach. For grains, you can have rice and oats. However, it's important to remember that everyone's tolerance to these foods can be different. Does this information help you understand your dietary recommendations better?\n\nPatient: Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Patient. I'm glad I could help. Now, in addition to the low FODMAP diet, you're also on a cardiac low sodium diet. This means you should aim to limit your sodium intake to less than 2,000 milligrams per day. This can be achieved by avoiding processed foods, not adding salt to your meals, and choosing fresh or frozen vegetables\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "That sounds like a good approach. Consuming low sodium and fresh meals can significantly help manage your heart health. Make sure to read food labels, as some foods labeled \"low-fat\" or \"low-sugar\" can still be high in sodium. Remember to drink plenty of fluids and include physical activity as part of your routine, which can help manage your heart condition. Do you have any more questions or concerns about your diet or medications?",
