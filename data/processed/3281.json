    "prompt": "Patient: Yes.\n\nNurse: instead of I'm glad I could help. Now, in addition to the low FODMAP diet, you're also on a cardiac low sodium diet. This means you should aim to limit your sodium intake to less than 2,000 milligrams per day. This can be achieved by avoiding processed foods, not adding salt to your meals, and choosing fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned ones. Also, you're on a 1.5 Liter Fluid Restriction. This means you should limit your total fluid intake, including drinks and soups, to 1.5 liters per day. Does this information help you understand your dietary recommendations better?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Patient. It's critical to remember that these dietary changes can help manage your CHF symptoms. Now, let's talk about exercise. Could you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: I take walks.\n\nNurse: That's great, Patient. Walking is a wonderful form of exercise. How often do you go for walks and how long are your walks usually?\n\nPatient: Every couple days,\n\nPatient: twenty minutes.",
