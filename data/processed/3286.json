    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, thank you. It's recommended that you aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, like brisk walking, most days of the week. This can be broken down into shorter sessions if that's more manageable for you. For example, you could aim for three 10-minute walks each day. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does this sound doable to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Patient. Remember, the goal is to gradually increase your activity level in a way that's comfortable for you. Now, I understand that adjusting diet and exercise can be hard. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on. I'll be informing Doctor Valencia about our conversation and how you're doing. Before we end this call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?\n\nPatient: I said no.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Patient. To summarize, we discussed your symptoms, medications, diet, and exercise. You're taking your prescribed medications, and you haven't noticed any new or worsening symptoms. You've been following a low FODMAP diet, and you understand the importance of limiting your sodium intake and keeping your fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day. As for exercise, you're currently walking a couple of times a week for about 20 minutes, and you've agreed to try increasing this to at least 30 minutes most days of the week, split into shorter sessions if preferred. Just to confirm, are you comfortable carrying out everything we've discussed?",
