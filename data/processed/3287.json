Now, I understand that adjusting diet and exercise can be hard. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on. I'll be informing Doctor Valencia about our conversation and how you're doing. Before we end this call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?\n\nPatient: I said no.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming, Patient. To summarize, you've agreed to try and gradually increase your walking time to a total of 30 minutes per day, split into shorter sessions if needed. You're also doing well managing your medications and your symptoms are stable. Can I count on you to continue these efforts?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
