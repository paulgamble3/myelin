    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Winner. After your surgery, it's important to eat a balanced diet to aid your recovery. This includes plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. It's also beneficial to limit your intake of sodium and sugars. Does that help?\n\nPatient: Yes. That helps.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Winner.\n\nPatient: You said limit sugar, Sensorio?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Winner. Limiting sugar can help manage your blood glucose levels, especially with your Type II Diabetes. This can also help with your overall health and recovery. Do you have any other questions about your diet?\n\nPatient: Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, got it. Not about diets. No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Winner. I'm glad we could discuss your diet. It's also important to stay active, and I'm sure you must be looking forward to getting a new knee. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once you've recovered from your surgery?\n\nPatient: Well, by the way, I wanted to ask, is it gonna hurt? Move around after the surgery.",

        "gpt4": "It's completely normal to feel some pain and discomfort after the surgery, Mr. Winner. But the medical team will provide you with appropriate pain relief medication to manage this. As your recovery progresses, the pain should gradually decrease. It's also important to remember that everyone's experience with pain is different. The physical therapy exercises you'll be encouraged to do after surgery will also play a big role in your recovery and help reduce discomfort over time. Does that answer your question?",
