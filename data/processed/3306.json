    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Winner. I'm glad we could discuss your diet. It's also important to stay active, and I'm sure you must be looking forward to getting a new knee. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once you've recovered from your surgery?\n\nPatient: Well, by the way, I wanted to ask, is it gonna hurt? Move around after the surgery.\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Winner, it's normal to experience some pain and discomfort after surgery. However, your healthcare team will provide you with medications to manage this. It's also important to start moving as soon as you can after surgery, as this can help with your recovery. Do you have any other questions about the procedure or recovery process?\n\nPatient: Yes. Well, what about my pain in the knee? Would get better, will it improve after the surgery?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Winner. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve pain and improve function in your knee. Most people experience significant pain relief and improved mobility after recovery. However, it's important to remember that everyone's recovery process is different. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Winner. I'm here to help, so feel free to ask any questions at any time during our conversation. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: I can't",
