        "gpt4": "Wonderful, Mr. Winner. Lastly, you'll need to gently scrub your skin for 5 minutes with the chlorhexidine solution applied on the washcloth. Afterward, rinse off the solution and pat dry with a clean towel. Does that make sense?",
        "our_model": "That's great, Mr. Winner. After you've scrubbed for about 5 minutes, you'll rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?"
