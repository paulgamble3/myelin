    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Mr. Winner, even water should not be consumed after midnight before your procedure. This is to ensure your stomach is completely empty for the anesthesia. It's a crucial safety measure. Do you have any other questions about this?\n\nPatient: Know.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Winner, could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: I said no.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Winner. I'm glad we could discuss that. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. Do you have any questions so far?\n\nPatient: No questions.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Winner. I just have a couple more questions for you. Firstly, have you noticed any signs of illness recently, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.",
