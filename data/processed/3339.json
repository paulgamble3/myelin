I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. Do you have any questions so far?\n\nPatient: No questions.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Winner. I just have a couple more questions for you. Firstly, have you noticed any signs of illness recently, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Winner. It's important to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I see that your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure. Is that still correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
