    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Winner. I just have a couple more questions for you. Firstly, have you noticed any signs of illness recently, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Winner. It's important to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I see that your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure. Is that still correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Winner. It's essential to have a plan in place for after your procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes. I got it all settled, like, months ago. When I was scheduled for the surgery.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Winner. It's important to have someone to assist you after the procedure. If you didn't have a ride home yet, I would have reassured you that you still have time to figure it out. But you will indeed need to get someone to be on standby to come pick you up when the hospital calls and stay with you afterwards.\n\nPatient: Thank you Need someone to stay with me for how long. Do you think?",

        "gpt4": "Having someone with you for the first 24 hours after surgery is key, Mr. Winner. Depending on how your recovery progresses, you might want that person to stay longer. You and that person will want to monitor for any potential complications or side effects from the surgery or anesthesia. Does that sound okay to you?",
