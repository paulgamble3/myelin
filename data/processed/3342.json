Is that still correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Winner. It's essential to have a plan in place for after your procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes. I got it all settled, like, months ago. When I was scheduled for the surgery.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Winner. It's important to have someone to assist you after the procedure. If you didn't have a ride home yet, I would have reassured you that you still have time to figure it out. But you will indeed need to get someone to be on standby to come pick you up when the hospital calls and stay with you afterwards.\n\nPatient: Thank you Need someone to stay with me for how long. Do you think?\n\nNurse: It's generally recommended to have someone stay with you for at least the first 24 hours after surgery, Mr. Winner. This person can help you with basic tasks, monitor your recovery, and call for help if needed. Does that sound doable?\n\nPatient: Mhmm.",
