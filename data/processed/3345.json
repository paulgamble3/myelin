    "prompt": "Patient: Mhmm.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Winner. It's essential to have that support in place. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Do I have any No. No. I think I'm all clear. You told me a lot about things, and I'm ready to do the scrub the surgery is in two days. So I'm kinda, like, really scared\n\nPatient: Am ready. I'm ready. Ready.\n\nNurse: I can certainly understand your feelings, Mr. Winner. It's completely normal to feel a bit scared before a procedure. But remember, you're in good hands with Doctor Stevens and the team at O'Connor Hospital. They've done this many times before and they're going to take great care of you. Do you have any specific concerns or questions you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Winner. I'm here to support you, so feel free to ask any questions at any time. Now, let's summarize what you still need to do before your procedure. You'll need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. You also need to stop eating and drinking after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: You can call me.",
