Regular screenings can indeed help in early detection and treatment. Before we delve into the details of your colonoscopy preparation, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Actually, I do have a question.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Kageyama. What's your question?\n\nPatient: Wanted to see if it's okay if I eat\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Kageyama, you were saying?\n\nPatient: some cherry\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Kageyama, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: Jell O on the day of my colonoscopy.",

        "gpt4": "With a colonoscopy, it's generally recommended to avoid eating anything solid on the day of the procedure, but clear liquids are often acceptable. Clear, uncolored Jell-O, such as lemon or lime, is generally okay, so that your colon can be clearly seen during the examination. However, red or purple colored foods like cherry Jell-O could potentially stain the colon and make it harder for your doctor to identify any issues. Alternatively, you might consider having chicken or vegetable broth or a clear sports drink lacking dye. How does that sound to you?",
        "our_model": "That's a good question, Mr. Kageyama. On the day of your colonoscopy, it's generally recommended to stick to a clear liquid diet. This includes items like broth, clear juices, and Jell-O. However, it's important to avoid any red or purple colored foods, including Jell-O, as they can interfere with the results of the procedure. So, cherry Jell-O would not be the best choice. Would you like to know about other foods that are suitable for your diet on the day of the procedure?"
