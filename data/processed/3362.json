    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Kageyama, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: Jell O on the day of my colonoscopy.\n\nNurse: That's a good question, Mr. Kageyama. On the day of your colonoscopy, it's generally recommended to stick to a clear liquid diet. This includes items like broth, clear juices, and Jell-O. However, it's important to avoid any red or purple colored foods, including Jell-O, as they can interfere with the results of the procedure. So, cherry Jell-O would not be the best choice. Would you like to know about other foods that are suitable for your diet on the day of the procedure?\n\nPatient: That answered my question. Thanks.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad I could help. If it's okay with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on preparing for your colonoscopy. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay, thank you, Mr. Kageyama. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with your current medication. You're prescribed Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. Can you confirm if you've been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.",

        "gpt4": "Great to hear that you've been managing your medication schedule well, Mr. Kageyama. To prepare for your colonoscopy, it's important to inform Dr. Bailey if you're taking medications like aspirin or ibuprofen. For your Tylenol dosage, there's no need to adjust it specifically for the colonoscopy. However, you should also avoid any iron supplements or medications containing iron a few days before your procedure as they can darken the inside of your colon. Before we move on, do you have any questions about managing your medications ahead of the colonoscopy?",
        "our_model": "That's great to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's essential to follow the prescribed dosage. Now, let's get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?"
