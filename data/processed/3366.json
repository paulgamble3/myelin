    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's essential to follow the prescribed dosage. Now, let's get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. Credit.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Kageyama. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Kageyama. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yep.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect, Mr. Kageyama. Let's discuss your medications now. Since you are prescribed Tylenol, you can continue this medication as prescribed as it won't interfere with the procedure. However, are you taking any blood thinners such as Advil, Aspirin, or Aleve apart from the Tylenol?",
        "our_model": "Perfect, Mr. Kageyama. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. There's no need to stop this medication before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this medication?"
