    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Kageyama. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. There's no need to stop this medication before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this medication?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's important to avoid those medications before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any other questions about medications before we move on to discussing your diet?\n\nPatient: Nope.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect, Mr. Kageyama. Now, let's discuss your diet in preparation for the colonoscopy. You'll want to start eating a low fiber diet today. This means you should eat foods like white bread, pasta, and well-cooked vegetables. However, you should avoid high fiber foods like whole grains, beans, and raw vegetables. This will make the preparation and procedure easier for you. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?",
