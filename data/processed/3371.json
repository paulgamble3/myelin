    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's important to avoid those medications before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any other questions about medications before we move on to discussing your diet?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. Let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: Nope. No questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the diet instructions. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Pasta quite a bit.",

        "gpt4": "It's great to hear you enjoy pasta, Mr. Kageyama. Pasta is indeed a good option as it is low in fiber. You could consider having pasta with some light butter or olive oil. Do you have a favorite type of pasta or a specific pasta dish you enjoy?",
        "our_model": "That's great, Mr. Kageyama. Pasta is indeed a good choice for a low fiber diet. You can enjoy it with a simple sauce, just remember to avoid high fiber ingredients like whole grain pasta or vegetables. Do you usually prepare your pasta in a specific way?"
