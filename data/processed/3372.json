    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's important to avoid those medications before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any other questions about medications before we move on to discussing your diet?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. Let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: Nope. No questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the diet instructions. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Pasta quite a bit.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Kageyama. Pasta is indeed a good choice for a low fiber diet. You can enjoy it with a simple sauce, just remember to avoid high fiber ingredients like whole grain pasta or vegetables. Do you usually prepare your pasta in a specific way?\n\nPatient: I just like it with a little bit of butter and salt.",

        "gpt4": "That sounds like a tasty and suitable choice for your low-fiber diet, Mr. Kageyama. You can certainly continue to enjoy your pasta with butter and salt in the days leading up to your colonoscopy. It's indeed a rare occasion when we would advise against eating fiber-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Don't worry we will help you get back on track after your colonoscopy. Now, could you share any other low fiber comfort foods you enjoy?",

Remember, this is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or shall we move on to discuss supplements?"
