    "prompt": "Nurse: That sounds like a simple and delicious way to enjoy pasta, Mr. Kageyama. It's also a good choice for your current diet. Remember, this is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or shall we move on to discuss supplements?\n\nPatient: We can move on.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. In addition to the diet changes, you'll also need to stop any supplements you take, like Psyllium husk, or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's important to avoid those supplements and medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: Hi. Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Rosalvan.",
