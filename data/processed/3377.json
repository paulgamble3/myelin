    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. In addition to the diet changes, you'll also need to stop any supplements you take, like Psyllium husk, or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's important to avoid those supplements and medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: Hi. Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Rosalvan.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the information so far.
