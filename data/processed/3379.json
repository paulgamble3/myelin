Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep.

        "gpt4": "That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. Just so we're clear, your bowel prep won't need to start just yet. However, when it's time, you'll need to start 24 hours before your procedure. During that time, you'll be on a clear liquid diet. This means no solid foods and only clear or light-colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I give you some examples of what clear liquids are, and you can tell me any questions you have about this?",
