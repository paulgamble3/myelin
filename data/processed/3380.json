    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the information so far. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Well,\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Kageyama?\n\nPatient: You know, it's what has to be done, isn't it?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Kageyama, you're absolutely right. It's a crucial part of the process to ensure a successful colonoscopy. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think I do.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling prepared. Just to remind you, you don't have to start the bowel prep just yet. You'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. Kageyama. Here are some examples: For clear liquids, you can have things like tea, coffee without milk, clear broths, apple juice or lemon-lime soda. For light colored beverages, sports drinks like lemon-lime Gatorade are also a good choice. You can also have Jello or other gelatin, just steer clear of anything red or purple. Do you have any questions or concerns about these options?",
        "our_model": "Great, Mr. Kageyama. Clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's important to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?"
