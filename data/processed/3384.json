    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Kageyama. Clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's important to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: Nope. No questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the clear liquid diet. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Kageyama. Here are a couple of tips that might make the bowel prep a bit easier for you. First, you can drink the laxative solution cold. This can make it more palatable. Second, you can drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier.
