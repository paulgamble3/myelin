    "prompt": "Nurse: easier for you. First, you can drink the laxative solution cold. This can make it more palatable. Second, you can drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. Do you have any questions about these tips or is there anything else you'd like to know about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: No. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad I could provide some helpful tips. Remember, some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. Now, let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I appreciate your patience. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been feeling well lately. Have you had any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad you're feeling well, Mr. Kageyama. It's crucial to ensure you're not feeling unwell before your colonoscopy. If you start to feel ill between now and your procedure, it's essential to let us know. Now, the last question I have is, have you already arranged for a ride home after the procedure? It's important to have someone available to drive you home since you'll be sedated during the procedure.",
