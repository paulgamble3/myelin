    "prompt": "Nurse: You're welcome, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad I could provide some helpful tips. Remember, some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. Now, let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I appreciate your patience. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been feeling well lately. Have you had any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's critical to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yeah. My son's gonna let him know.",
