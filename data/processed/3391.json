It's critical to have someone available to take you home after the procedure. I'm glad to hear that your son will be there for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the logistics of your procedure?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. That was all the topics for today. Before we wrap up, do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't. Hello?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Kageyama, I'm here. I'm glad to hear that you don't have any other questions. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over your diet, medication, and bowel prep instructions. We also confirmed that you're feeling well and have arranged for a ride home after your procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
