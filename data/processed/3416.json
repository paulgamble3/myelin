    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Jimenez. It's important to note that medications like Aspirin are blood thinners and typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I would advise you to discuss this with your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Jimenez. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss regarding this topic?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Jimenez. Let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Jimenez. You're well-prepared. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. Jimenez. After you've turned the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. You need to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Will you be able to do that?",
