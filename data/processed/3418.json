    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Jimenez. Let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Jimenez. You're well-prepared. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Jimenez. After you've turned the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. Remember to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Jimenez. Finally, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that was a lot. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",
