        "our_model": "That's a great question. The DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, is a good choice for managing your conditions. It emphasizes eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy, while limiting foods high in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium. It's also important to limit your sodium intake to less than 2000 mg per day. This can help manage your blood pressure and protect your kidneys. Would it be okay if I share some specific foods you might want to include or avoid in your diet?"
