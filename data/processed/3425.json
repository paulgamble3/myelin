    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Jimenez. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. Not real.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Jimenez. I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness. Do you currently have a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Jimenez. It's essential to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Mr. Jimenez. It's critical to have a plan in place for when you return home. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
