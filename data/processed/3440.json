    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent, thank you, Ms. Aguirre. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: Wood twenty eight.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Aguirre, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your last blood sugar reading?\n\nPatient: One twenty eight.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Aguirre. A blood sugar level of 128 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: No. That's okay.",
