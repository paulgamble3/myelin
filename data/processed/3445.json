    "prompt": "Nurse: I appreciate you letting me know. Give me a moment to check how I can best help you. I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you. Thank you for confirming, Ms. Aguirre. I understand that you don't want any recommendations at this time. Let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure measurement?\n\nPatient: Today.\n\nNurse: That's great, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please tell me what the result was?\n\nPatient: One twenty over eighty five.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Aguirre. A blood pressure reading of 120 over 85 is within the acceptable range. It's essential to keep monitoring it regularly. Do you have any questions about your blood pressure or the readings you've been getting?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Aguirre. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What does the potassium and sodium mean?",

        "gpt4": "Certainly, Ms. Aguirre. Sodium and potassium are types of electrolytes in your body. Sodium helps control your body's fluid balance and impacts blood pressure. Your recent sodium level was 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range, indicating your body's fluid balance is well maintained. Potassium helps keep nerves and muscles, especially the heart, working correctly. Your potassium level was 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range, indicating your nerves and muscles are functioning well. \n\nDo you have any other questions about these labs or any other lab results?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question, Ms. Aguirre. Sodium and potassium are both types of electrolytes, which are minerals in your body that have an electric charge. They are necessary for your body to function properly, including your heart, muscles, and nerves. Sodium helps control your body's fluid balance and also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Potassium helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, to function properly. The normal range for sodium is typically between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). The normal range for potassium is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 mEq/L. Your recent lab results showed a sodium level of 137 mEq/L and a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, which are both within the normal ranges. Does that help clarify things for you, Ms. Aguirre?"
