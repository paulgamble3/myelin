    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Ms. Aguirre. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What does the potassium and sodium mean?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Ms. Aguirre. Sodium and potassium are both types of electrolytes, which are minerals in your body that have an electric charge. They are necessary for your body to function properly, including your heart, muscles, and nerves. Sodium helps control your body's fluid balance and also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Potassium helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, to function properly. The normal range for sodium is typically between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). The normal range for potassium is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 mEq/L. Your recent lab results showed a sodium level of 137 mEq/L and a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, which are both within the normal ranges. Does that help clarify things for you, Ms. Aguirre?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Aguirre. If you have any other questions about your lab results or anything else, feel free to ask. Now, I'd like to discuss your medications. You're currently taking Metformin 500 mg once a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Ms. Aguirre. Sticking to your medication schedule is crucial in managing your conditions. Now, let's move on to the next medication. You're also prescribed Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as directed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
