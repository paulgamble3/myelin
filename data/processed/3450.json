You're currently taking Metformin 500 mg once a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Ms. Aguirre. Sticking to your medication schedule is crucial in managing your conditions. Now, let's move on to the next medication.

Have you been taking this medication as directed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Aguirre. It's essential to take Tylenol only when you need it for pain. Lastly, you're prescribed Atorvastatin 40 mg, which you should be taking once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Ms. Aguirre. It's critical to take your Atorvastatin as prescribed to manage your cholesterol levels. I want to acknowledge that it's common to miss a dose here or there.
