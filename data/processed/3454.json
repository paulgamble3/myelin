    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Ms. Aguirre, I'm here. I was asking if you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's fantastic, Ms. Aguirre. You're doing a great job managing your medications. I also want to remind you that there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for patients with chronic kidney disease to take. It's critical to talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Aguirre. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to discuss your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: I'm on a low carb, low salt diet. So what food should I be eating as stage four CKD patient.\n\nNurse: It's great to hear that you're following a low carb and low salt diet, Ms. Aguirre. As a Stage IV CKD patient, it's important to follow a diet that's low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. This means avoiding foods like bananas, oranges, potatoes, and dairy products. Instead, you should focus on foods like apples, berries, peppers, and lean meats. Would it be okay if I provide some more detailed recommendations?\n\nPatient: No. That's okay.",
