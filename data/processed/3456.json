    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Ms. Aguirre. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to discuss your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: I'm on a low carb, low salt diet. So what food should I be eating as stage four CKD patient.\n\nNurse: It's great to hear that you're following a low carb and low salt diet, Ms. Aguirre. As a Stage IV CKD patient, it's important to follow a diet that's low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. This means avoiding foods like bananas, oranges, potatoes, and dairy products. Instead, you should focus on foods like apples, berries, peppers, and lean meats. Would it be okay if I provide some more detailed recommendations?\n\nPatient: No. That's okay.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your response, Ms. Aguirre. You're doing a great job following a low carb and low salt diet. Remember, it's always important to consult with your doctor or a dietitian before making any major changes to your diet. Now, let's move on to discuss your back surgeries. How has your recovery been going?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Aguirre. It's important to continue with any physical therapy or exercises recommended by your doctor to aid in your recovery. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices?\n\nPatient: Yes. I do.",
