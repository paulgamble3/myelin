Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices?\n\nPatient: Yes. I do.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Aguirre. I know it's not easy to talk about. Have you ever considered quitting smoking?\n\nPatient: No. I don't really want to.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Aguirre. It's a big decision to make. Could you share with me why you feel you're not ready to quit smoking at this time?\n\nPatient: Just too much of a commitment right now.\n\nNurse: I understand, Ms. Aguirre. It's a significant change and it's okay to feel that it's too much right now. If you ever decide to consider quitting, I have a lot of resources that I could share with you. Would you like me to share these resources with you for future reference?\n\nPatient: No.",
