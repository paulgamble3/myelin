    "prompt": "Nurse: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Aguirre. It's a big decision to make. Could you share with me why you feel you're not ready to quit smoking at this time?\n\nPatient: Just too much of a commitment right now.\n\nNurse: I understand, Ms. Aguirre. It's a significant change and it's okay to feel that it's too much right now. If you ever decide to consider quitting, I have a lot of resources that I could share with you. Would you like me to share these resources with you for future reference?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Aguirre. If you ever change your mind, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to support you. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Aguirre. To summarize, you've been doing a great job managing your conditions. You're taking your medications as prescribed, following a low carb and low salt diet, and monitoring your blood sugar and blood pressure regularly. I'm glad to hear that you're recovering well from your back surgeries. Can I count on you to continue these practices?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
