Do you have any specific concerns or questions you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. Not that I can think of right now.\n\nNurse: Alright.

It's great that you're taking this step to take care of your health. How are you feeling about the procedure?\n\nPatient: Like I said, I'm I'm nervous.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your honesty. It's completely normal to feel nervous. I'm here to help you prepare for the procedure and answer any questions you might have.
