You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Okay. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great. Is there anything else about the logistics that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds worrying you?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",

        "gpt4": "Excellent. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Ferrous Sulfate 200 mg once a day. It's important to know that you need to stop taking this medication 5 days prior to your procedure. You'd need to stop your Ferrous Sulfate from August 12. Do you have any questions about this?",

For your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking this medication 5 days prior to the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12, which is 5 days from today. Does that make sense?"
