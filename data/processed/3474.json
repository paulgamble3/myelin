    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great. Is there anything else about the logistics that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds worrying you?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Perfect. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Ferrous Sulfate 200 mg once a day. For your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking this medication 5 days prior to the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12, which is 5 days from today. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
