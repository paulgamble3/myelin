    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. In addition to the dietary changes, you'll also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. These types of supplements can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm pretty ferrous.\n\nNurse: I can understand why you might feel a bit nervous. It's a big change from your normal diet. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep was a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Great. I want to stress that you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, so you can tell me which ones you are comfortable with?",
