    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. These types of supplements can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm pretty ferrous.\n\nNurse: I can understand why you might feel a bit nervous. It's a big change from your normal diet. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep was a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Examples of clear liquids include water, clear broth or bouillon, black coffee or tea (no milk or cream), sports drinks like Gatorade, clear fruit juices like apple juice, soft drinks, and plain gelatin. You should not eat or drink anything that is red or purple because they can look like blood during the colonoscopy. Does this clear liquid diet make sense? Do you have any questions or concerns about this diet?",
        "our_model": "Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any questions about these examples or the clear liquid diet in general?"
