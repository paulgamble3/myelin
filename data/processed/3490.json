    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm pretty ferrous.\n\nNurse: I can understand why you might feel a bit nervous. It's a big change from your normal diet. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep was a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any questions about these examples or the clear liquid diet in general?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Great. As you remember, after you've been on the clear liquid diet for one day, you'll also need to take the NuLYTELY solution. This is a powerful laxative that will clean out your bowel so the doctor can see everything clearly during your colonoscopy. You'll need to drink the entire gallon of solution before the procedure. Can we discuss this now?",
        "our_model": "Alright. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?"
