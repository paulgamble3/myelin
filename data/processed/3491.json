    "prompt": "Nurse: I can understand why you might feel a bit nervous. It's a big change from your normal diet. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep was a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any questions about these examples or the clear liquid diet in general?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

It tends to taste better when it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds cold.\n\n- Drink the solution with a straw. This can help it bypass some of your taste buds.\n\n- If allowed by your doctor, you can add a non-red, non-purple flavor packet like lemon or lime to the solution.\n\n- Lastly, remember you can take small breaks. You don't have to chug it all at once.\n\nDoes this help? Do you have any other questions about the bowel prep?",
