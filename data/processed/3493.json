    "prompt": "Nurse: Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any questions about these examples or the clear liquid diet in general?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. You can drink the laxative solution cold. This can make it easier to drink. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or the tips I shared?\n\nPatient: No.",

It's critical to follow the instructions to ensure the colonoscopy goes smoothly. Now, let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?"
