Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. You can drink the laxative solution cold. This can make it easier to drink. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or the tips I shared?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine.

        "gpt4": "Great. It's crucial to refrain from eating or drinking anything within four hours of your procedure to ensure it can be done safely and effectively. If you feel thirsty during these final four hours, remember to just rinse your mouth with water but don't swallow any. Are you okay with this?",
