    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's important to have someone available to take you home after the procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the logistics of your procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over your medication, the low fiber diet, the clear liquid diet, the bowel prep, and the need to arrange a ride home after the procedure. You've agreed to follow these instructions. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
