    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Martin. Now, have you noticed any increased swelling in your feet, ankles, stomach, or legs?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Martin. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Martin. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Martin. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep an eye on these symptoms at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be a bit complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No. And I don't really think it's that complicated.",

        "gpt4": "That's fantastic, Mr. Martin. It's great that you feel comfortable monitoring your symptoms. Remember, any changes in your symptoms are important to report to your doctor. Now, do you have any other questions or concerns for me or Dr. Rodriguez?",
        "our_model": "I apologize for the confusion earlier, Mr. Martin. To confirm, you said you haven't been using more pillows to sleep, correct?"
