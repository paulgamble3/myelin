    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great, Mr. Martin. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Martin. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Martin. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep an eye on these symptoms at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be a bit complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No. And I don't really think it's that complicated.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Mr. Martin. To confirm, you said you haven't been using more pillows to sleep, correct?\n\nPatient: Correct.",
