        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Martin. Regular exercise is beneficial for managing CHF and your weight. It's great that you're already maintaining an active lifestyle. Here's a few recommendations:\n\n1. Try to include some light strength training exercises. They can help increase muscle mass and metabolism.\n2. Maybe consider adding light cardio workouts to your routine if you're up for it, such as a brisk walk or a leisurely bike ride.\n3. The most important thing is consistency. This doesn't mean you have to exercise intensely every day, but aim for a set routine, such as 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week.\n\nRemember, it's always important to listen to your body. If any exercise causes discomfort or feels too strenuous, it's okay to stop and rest. Does this information help, and do you feel comfortable incorporating these suggestions into your exercise routine?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Martin. It's recommended that you engage in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, like brisk walking or cycling, for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. It's also beneficial to include strength training exercises twice a week. However, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. How does this fit with your current routine?"
