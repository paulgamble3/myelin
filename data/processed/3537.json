    "prompt": "Nurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Martin. It's great that you're staying active. With your permission, I'd like to provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Martin. It's recommended that you engage in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, like brisk walking or cycling, for at least 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week. It's also beneficial to include strength training exercises twice a week. However, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. How does this fit with your current routine?\n\nPatient: I don't know. I'll give it a try.\n\nNurse: That's all we can ask for, Mr. Martin. Trying new things can sometimes lead to great results. I understand that adjusting diet and exercise can be hard. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Martin. I'll be sure to inform Doctor Rodriguez about our conversation and how you're doing. Before we end the call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",
