    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent, Mr. Gardner. And how have you been taking your Lasix medication?\n\nPatient: Hi.\n\nNurse: Hello again, Mr. Gardner. I was asking about how you've been taking your Lasix medication. Is it two times a day as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes, sir.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Gardner. Now, are you still taking your Valsartan?\n\nPatient: Yes. But they increased my dosage.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Gardner. So, you're now taking 80 mg of Valsartan two times a day. That's a significant change. How are you managing with the increased dosage?\n\nPatient: Just five",
