Is it two times a day as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes, sir.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Gardner. Now, are you still taking your Valsartan?\n\nPatient: Yes. But they increased my dosage.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Gardner. So, you're now taking 80 mg of Valsartan two times a day. That's a significant change. How are you managing with the increased dosage?\n\nPatient: Just five\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: Good.",
