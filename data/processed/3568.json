Could you please repeat what you typically eat in a day?\n\nPatient: I eat, like, fish\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Gardner. Fish is a good source of protein.

        "gpt4": "Absolutely, Mr. Gardner. The fluid restriction refers to the total amount of fluids, in your case, 1.5 liters per day. This includes not only beverages but also foods that contain a lot of water like soups, fruits, and certain vegetables. It's important to monitor your intake to help manage your CHF. Are there any specific questions you have about the fluid restriction?",
