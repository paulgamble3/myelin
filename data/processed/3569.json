        "gpt4": "Sure, Mr. Gardner. Patients with heart conditions, like yourself, are often advised to limit their fluid intake. This helps to prevent fluid buildup in your body that can lead to complications such as shortness of breath and swelling. A common guideline is to limit fluid intake to about 2 liters per day, but your doctor may recommend a different amount based on your individual condition. \n\nIt's not just beverages that count, foods that are high in water, such as soups, ice cream, or fruits like watermelon, also count towards your daily fluid intake. I recommend speaking with your doctor or a nutritionist for more personalized advice.\n\nDo you have any specific questions on fluid restriction?",
        "our_model": "I see, Mr. Gardner. You're interested in learning more about your fluid restriction. You're currently on a 1.5 Liter fluid restriction. This includes all fluids, not just water, such as soup, coffee, or any other beverages. It's critical to keep track of your fluid intake throughout the day to ensure you're not exceeding this limit. Do you have any questions about this?"
