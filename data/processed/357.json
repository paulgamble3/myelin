How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Exactly. You said it right?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Koroleva. It's a significant step, and I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. If it's okay with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
