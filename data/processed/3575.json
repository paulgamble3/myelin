    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great question, Mr. Gardner. One way to measure your fluid intake is to use a water bottle with measurements on it. A 1.5-liter water bottle would be ideal. You can also use a measuring cup to measure out other beverages or soups. Do you think this will be manageable for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Gardner. I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, let's talk about your diet. You mentioned you've been eating healthily, focusing on fish and chicken. That's a good start. I'd also like to discuss your sodium intake. You're currently on a 1500 mg sodium restricted diet. This means being mindful of not just the foods you eat, but also any seasonings or sauces you might add. Would you like some suggestions on how to manage your sodium intake?\n\nPatient: No. That's okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Gardner. If you ever have any questions or need suggestions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to exercise. You mentioned earlier that you enjoy walking. That's a great way to stay active. How often do you walk and for how long?\n\nPatient: About\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat how often you walk and for how long?\n\nPatient: three times a week, twenty minutes a piece.",

Do you find your current walking schedule manageable, or would you like some suggestions on how you could possibly modify it?",
