    "prompt": "Nurse: You're welcome, Mr. Gardner. I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, let's talk about your diet. You mentioned you've been eating healthily, focusing on fish and chicken. That's a good start. I'd also like to discuss your sodium intake. You're currently on a 1500 mg sodium restricted diet. This means being mindful of not just the foods you eat, but also any seasonings or sauces you might add. Would you like some suggestions on how to manage your sodium intake?\n\nPatient: No. That's okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Gardner. If you ever have any questions or need suggestions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to exercise. You mentioned earlier that you enjoy walking. That's a great way to stay active. How often do you walk and for how long?\n\nPatient: About\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat how often you walk and for how long?\n\nPatient: three times a week, twenty minutes a piece.\n\nNurse: That's a good start, Mr. Gardner. Walking three times a week for twenty minutes is a great way to stay active. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations on how you might be able to gradually increase your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Excellent, Mr. Gardner. With CHF, it's important to increase your activity level gradually and safely. Building up to a goal of walking for thirty minutes a day, five days a week can be beneficial. One way to do this could be by adding an extra five minutes to your walk each week until you reach this goal. Always remember to listen to your body and rest if you need to. Does this seem like a reasonable plan?",
        "our_model": "Excellent, Mr. Gardner. One suggestion could be to gradually increase the frequency of your walks. For example, you could aim to walk four times a week instead of three. Another suggestion could be to slowly increase the duration of your walks. For instance, you could aim to walk for 25 minutes instead of 20. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does this sound manageable to you?"
