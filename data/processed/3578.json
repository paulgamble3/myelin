    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat how often you walk and for how long?\n\nPatient: three times a week, twenty minutes a piece.\n\nNurse: That's a good start, Mr. Gardner. Walking three times a week for twenty minutes is a great way to stay active. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations on how you might be able to gradually increase your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Gardner. One suggestion could be to gradually increase the frequency of your walks. For example, you could aim to walk four times a week instead of three. Another suggestion could be to slowly increase the duration of your walks. For instance, you could aim to walk for 25 minutes instead of 20. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does this sound manageable to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Gardner. Remember, the goal is to gradually increase your activity level in a way that's comfortable for you. It's critical not to rush or push yourself too hard. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: No.",
