    "prompt": "Nurse: I can imagine that it's a lot to take in, Mr. Koroleva. It's completely normal to feel this way. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to the presence of pus and mucus in your stool. It can indeed be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Exactly. You said it right?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Koroleva. It's a significant step, and I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. If it's okay with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Koroleva. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: Not at the moment.\n\nPatient: Thank you.\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]",
