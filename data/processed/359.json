I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: Not at the moment.\n\nPatient: Thank you.\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 10:00 AM.
