    "prompt": "Nurse: That's okay, Mr. Benton. Sometimes it's just about taking one day at a time. Before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, do you have any symptoms or concerns you'd like to share with me?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Benton. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, please feel free to share them. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics to check on how you're doing?\n\nPatient: I guess.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Benton. I see from your records that you have Type II Diabetes. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Not really.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Benton. It's really important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly when you have diabetes. Would you be open to starting this practice?\n\nPatient: I guess.",
