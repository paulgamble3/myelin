Would you be open to starting this practice?\n\nPatient: I guess.\n\nNurse: Thank you for being open to this, Mr. Benton. It's a small step that can make a big difference in managing your diabetes. When do you think you could start checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: I don't know.\n\nNurse: That's okay, Mr. Benton. There's no rush. Whenever you feel ready to start, that's the right time. Now, let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time\n\nPatient: Maybe.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Benton. It's a new habit\n\nPatient: Tomorrow.",
