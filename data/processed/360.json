Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: Not at the moment.\n\nPatient: Thank you.\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 10:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Okay. Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Koroleva. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: I think so.",
