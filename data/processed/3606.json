    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for being open to suggestions, Mr. Benton. One thing you could try is reducing your salt intake. This can help lower blood pressure. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: I guess it\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Benton, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: fine. I'm already on a low salt diet though.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Benton. Sticking to a low salt diet is indeed beneficial for managing blood pressure. As an alternative suggestion, regular physical activity can also help manage blood pressure. This could be a short walk around your neighborhood or some light stretching exercises at home. Would you be open to trying this?\n\nPatient: I guess if I have time,\n\nNurse: That's a good approach, Mr. Benton. Incorporating physical activity into your routine can be as simple as taking a short walk during a break. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: What are bun and creatinine?",

        "gpt4": "BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) and creatinine are two substances that doctors usually measure to check kidney function. Urea and creatinine are waste products that your kidneys remove from your body. If your kidney function is impaired, the levels of these substances in your blood may rise. Do you have further questions about this?",
        "our_model": "Of course, Mr. Benton. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen. It's a waste product that's produced in your body when protein is broken down. Creatinine is another waste product that's produced by your muscles. Both of these are normally removed from your blood by your kidneys. When your kidneys aren't working as well as they should, these levels can rise. Does that help clarify things for you?"
