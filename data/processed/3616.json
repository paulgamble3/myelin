        "gpt4": "Great question, Mr. Benton. Following your current low salt DASH diet is already a good start. Another beneficial practice would be to limit protein intake, particularly from animal sources. This could reduce the amount of waste products your kidneys need to filter. However, it's crucial to keep a balanced diet, so you're also getting enough protein for your body needs. Remember to keep well-hydrated, too. What are your thoughts on these suggestions?",
        "our_model": "It's great to hear that you're following the DASH diet, Mr. Benton. It's a good choice for managing your conditions.
