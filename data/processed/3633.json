    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Benton, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please confirm what you said about your blood sugar?\n\nPatient: Why did I have to pee in a cup\n\nNurse: Give me a moment to check how I can best support you. Give me a moment while I figure out how I can best help you.\n\nPatient: for the urine albumin test.\n\nNurse: That's a good question, Mr. Benton. The urine albumin test measures the amount of albumin in your urine. Albumin is a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. This test helps your doctor determine how well your kidneys are working. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: But why do I no. Yeah. It does.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could help clarify that for you, Mr. Benton. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I have one more question.",
