    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad I could help clarify that for you, Mr. Benton. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I have one more question.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Benton. What's your question?\n\nPatient: And I realized it's probably too late to ask this. But what exactly is stage two CKD.\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Benton. Stage II Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) means that your kidneys are not working as well as they should, but the damage is still mild. It's usually determined by a Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) between 60 and 89, or a urine albumin level of 30 to 299 mg/g. It's critical to manage this condition to prevent further kidney damage. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could help clarify that for you, Mr. Benton. To summarize, you've agreed to start checking your blood sugar daily and to consider incorporating some physical activity into your routine. Can I count on you to do these things?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
