    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling uncomfortable. It's quite common to need some time to adjust after a hospital stay. On a lighter note, do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy?\n\nPatient: No. None of your business.\n\nNurse: I apologize if I seemed intrusive. I'm here to help you with your health. I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Sarah Forbes. Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address before we go through a few topics?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to your medications. Are you still taking your Lasix and Lisinopril as prescribed by Doctor Forbes?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. How about Gabapentin and Tylenol?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
