Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move forward. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yes. I'm okay to continue. Thank you.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Koroleva. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day. For your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Do you have any questions about this medication change?\n\nPatient: Oh, yeah. Why do I need to stop it?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Koroleva. Xarelto is a type of blood thinner, and it's important to stop it before your colonoscopy to reduce the risk of bleeding during the procedure. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Oh, yeah. Of course, I don't want to I don't wanna bleed during the procedure. So Thank you. Yeah.",
