I don't have trouble with that because I'm not an idiot.\n\nNurse: I apologize for any misunderstanding. I'm glad to hear that you're managing your medications well. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I guess,\n\nNurse: Thank you. Let's start with your breathing. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Have you experienced any ongoing or worsening chest pain?\n\nPatient: No.",
