    "prompt": "Nurse: I see. It's essential to monitor this closely. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Yeah. How about three pounds?\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that.\n\nPatient: In the past day.\n\nNurse: I see. Sudden weight gain can be a sign of fluid retention, which is something we need to monitor closely. Have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to do this at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No.",
