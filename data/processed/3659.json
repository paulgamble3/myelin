    "prompt": "Patient: In the past day.\n\nNurse: I see. Sudden weight gain can be a sign of fluid retention, which is something we need to monitor closely. Have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to do this at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, I'd like to talk about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Who gives this shit?\n\nPatient: I don't I don't understand this. I don't wanna talk to an AI.",
