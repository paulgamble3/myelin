    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Koroleva. Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move forward. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yes. I'm okay to continue. Thank you.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Koroleva. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day. For your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Do you have any questions about this medication change?\n\nPatient: Oh, yeah. Why do I need to stop it?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Koroleva. Xarelto is a type of blood thinner, and it's important to stop it before your colonoscopy to reduce the risk of bleeding during the procedure. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Oh, yeah. Of course, I don't want to I don't wanna bleed during the procedure. So Thank you. Yeah.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Koroleva. Your safety is our top priority. Are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: Sometimes for the headache,",

        "gpt4": "Certainly, occasional headaches can be bothersome. Some over-the-counter medications for headaches contain substances that can thin the blood, much like Xarelto. These might include Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or similar--are any of these what you take for your headaches? If so, these will need to be stopped for a few days before your colonoscopy as well. Please, let me know if this is the case.",
        "our_model": "I see, Mr. Koroleva. If you're taking Advil or Aspirin for your headaches, it's important to stop these medications before your colonoscopy as well. They are also blood thinners and can increase the risk of bleeding during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?"
