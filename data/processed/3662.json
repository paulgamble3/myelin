    "prompt": "Patient: Who gives this shit?\n\nPatient: I don't I don't understand this. I don't wanna talk to an AI.\n\nNurse: I understand that this can be frustrating, but I'm here to help you manage your health. If you could just share a bit about your recent meals, it would be very helpful.\n\nPatient: I whatever the hell I want right show. That's what I eat.\n\nNurse: I see. It's essential to enjoy what we eat. Can you tell me a bit more about what you typically have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?\n\nPatient: I don't think about it too hard. I just I just grab something and I eat it.\n\nNurse: I see. It's important to be mindful of what we eat, especially for managing CHF and osteoarthritis. Would it be okay if I share some dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Sure. Whatever.",

        "gpt4": "Alright. CHF management often involves restricting fluids to about 1 liter a day. This helps prevent fluid from building up in your body. Are you okay with this recommendation?",
        "our_model": "Thank you. For managing CHF, it's recommended to limit your fluid intake to 1 liter per day. This includes all fluids, not just water. Also, a diet restricted to 1500 mg of sodium per day is advised. This means avoiding processed foods and adding less salt to your meals. Does that make sense?"
