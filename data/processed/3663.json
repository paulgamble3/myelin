    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand that this can be frustrating, but I'm here to help you manage your health. If you could just share a bit about your recent meals, it would be very helpful.\n\nPatient: I whatever the hell I want right show. That's what I eat.\n\nNurse: I see. It's essential to enjoy what we eat. Can you tell me a bit more about what you typically have for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?\n\nPatient: I don't think about it too hard. I just I just grab something and I eat it.\n\nNurse: I see. It's important to be mindful of what we eat, especially for managing CHF and osteoarthritis. Would it be okay if I share some dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Sure. Whatever.\n\nNurse: Thank you. For managing CHF, it's recommended to limit your fluid intake to 1 liter per day. This includes all fluids, not just water. Also, a diet restricted to 1500 mg of sodium per day is advised. This means avoiding processed foods and adding less salt to your meals. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
