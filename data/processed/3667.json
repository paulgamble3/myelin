    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful. Now, based on what you've shared about your meals, it might be helpful to plan ahead and prepare meals that align with these recommendations. Would you like some suggestions on how to do this?\n\nPatient: I guess.\n\nNurse: Excellent. For breakfast, you could have oatmeal with fresh fruits and a sprinkle of cinnamon instead of sugar. For lunch, a salad with grilled chicken, a variety of vegetables, and a low-sodium dressing could be a good option. For dinner, you could have a lean protein like grilled fish with a side of steamed vegetables and brown rice. These are just suggestions. It's critical to find meals that you enjoy and are good for your health. How do these suggestions sound to you?\n\nPatient: Freaking spectacular.\n\nNurse: I'm glad you found them helpful. Remember, the goal is to enjoy your meals while also taking care of your health. Do you have any questions or concerns about these dietary recommendations?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about exercise. Could you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: I do fuck all for exercise. I hate exercising.",
