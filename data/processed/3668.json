        "gpt4": "That's great to hear. Regular physical activity can help manage your symptoms and improve your overall well-being. It's recommended to aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. This could be as simple as a brisk walk for 30 minutes, five times a week. Doing strength training exercises at least two days a week can also be beneficial. It's important to start slow and gradually increase intensity and duration. How does that sound to you?",
