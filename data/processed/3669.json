        "gpt4": "I appreciate your willingness. Regular physical activity can help improve your overall health. It may include walking, swimming, cycling, or doing chores around the house. The aim should be to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity on most days of the week. You can start slowly and gradually increase your activity level. How does this sound to you?",
