Of course, I don't want to I don't wanna bleed during the procedure. So Thank you. Yeah.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Koroleva. Your safety is our top priority. Are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: Sometimes for the headache,\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Koroleva.

They are also blood thinners and can increase the risk of bleeding during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No. But I had no idea. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Koroleva. It's critical to be aware of all the medications you're taking, especially before a procedure.
