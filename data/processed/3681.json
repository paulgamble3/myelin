I'm ready, Freddie.\n\nNurse: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions before a procedure like this. It's a big step, but a positive one towards improving your quality of life. Before we move on, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Questions or concerns.\n\nPatient: Yeah. Do you think do you think I'll be able to move to move freely after the surgery.\n\nNurse: Yes, that's the goal of a total knee replacement.

While everyone's experience is a little different, many patients experience significant pain relief after they've fully recovered from the procedure.

Pain management after the surgery will be carefully guided by your medical team to keep you as comfortable as possible.",
