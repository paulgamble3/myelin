    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Well, yeah, I have this marks months now. So\n\nNurse: Great, it's good to hear that you're well-prepared. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Sound good.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes. Let's move on. Let's move on.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect. Now, regarding your medications. I see on your chart that you are on Jardiance, Hydrochlorothiazide, Atorvastatin, and Ozempic. I want to check if you've been instructed to stop any of these medications before the surgery?",
        "our_model": "Perfect. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance, Hydrochlorothiazide, Atorvastatin, and Ozempic. There are no changes to these medications before your surgery. Are you still taking these medications as prescribed?"
