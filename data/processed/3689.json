Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Sound good.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes. Let's move on. Let's move on.\n\nNurse: Perfect. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance, Hydrochlorothiazide, Atorvastatin, and Ozempic. There are no changes to these medications before your surgery. Are you still taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: I am. Yes.",
