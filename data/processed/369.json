    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Koroleva. Your safety is our top priority. Are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: Sometimes for the headache,\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Koroleva. If you're taking Advil or Aspirin for your headaches, it's important to stop these medications before your colonoscopy as well. They are also blood thinners and can increase the risk of bleeding during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No. But I had no idea. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Koroleva. It's critical to be aware of all the medications you're taking, especially before a procedure. Do you have any other questions about medications?\n\nPatient: Hi. No. I understand about the blood thinners. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Koroleva. I'm glad to hear that you understand. Now, let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, rice, and pasta, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: No. I don't, but it's Sounds boring, but okay. I can I can handle it?",
