    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes. Let's move on. Let's move on.\n\nNurse: Perfect. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance, Hydrochlorothiazide, Atorvastatin, and Ozempic. There are no changes to these medications before your surgery. Are you still taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: I am. Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: I I stopped aspirin. I did not know you needed to stop, though.\n\nNurse: That's correct.\n\nPatient: I did stop, though.",

        "gpt4": "Great, you've done the right thing. Aspirin is a blood thinner, and it's typically recommended to stop these medications before a knee replacement unless your doctor advised you otherwise. Have you any questions about that?",
        "our_model": "That's great. It's essential to stop taking Aspirin before your surgery. Do you have any questions about this or any other medication?"
