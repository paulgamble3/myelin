Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: I I stopped aspirin. I did not know you needed to stop, though.\n\nNurse: That's correct.\n\nPatient: I did stop, though.\n\nNurse: That's great. It's essential to stop taking Aspirin before your surgery.
