    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great. It's essential to stop taking Aspirin before your surgery. Do you have any questions about this or any other medication?\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: I see that you've also been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: I got it all picked up. Yep.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. You're well-prepared. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns?\n\nPatient: Block centers, basically. I'm very curious about the block centers. Like, Why do we need to stop them? I've heard it so many times, but honestly, I still don't understand why.\n\nNurse: That's a great question. Aspirin and other blood thinners are usually stopped before surgery because they can increase the risk of bleeding. During surgery, it's important to avoid excessive bleeding to ensure a safe and successful procedure. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: In, what do you mean by bleeding?",
    "responses": {
        "gpt4": "During any surgical procedure, some amount of bleeding is normal because it involves making incisions into the body. Blood thinners can prevent blood from clotting as quickly as it should, which can lead to an increased amount of bleeding during and even after surgery. This can make the surgery more difficult and could increase the risk of complications. It's standard procedure to stop taking these kinds of medications before surgery to minimize these risks. Does that clear things up?",
        "our_model": "I mean that these medications can make it easier for you to bleed, or make bleeding more severe if it does occur. This is because they work by thinning your blood, which can be helpful in preventing blood clots, but not ideal during surgery. Does that make sense?"
