    "prompt": "Nurse: I see that you've also been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: I got it all picked up. Yep.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. You're well-prepared. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns?\n\nPatient: Block centers, basically. I'm very curious about the block centers. Like, Why do we need to stop them? I've heard it so many times, but honestly, I still don't understand why.\n\nNurse: That's a great question. Aspirin and other blood thinners are usually stopped before surgery because they can increase the risk of bleeding. During surgery, it's important to avoid excessive bleeding to ensure a safe and successful procedure. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: In, what do you mean by bleeding?\n\nNurse: I mean that these medications can make it easier for you to bleed, or make bleeding more severe if it does occur. This is because they work by thinning your blood, which can be helpful in preventing blood clots, but not ideal during surgery. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Like, I I don't understand. Bleeding What do you mean?",

        "gpt4": "Sure, I'm sorry for any confusion. When we talk about bleeding in this context, we're referring to how much you might bleed during surgery. Blood thinners can increase this amount because they prevent blood clots from forming. That's usualy a good thing, but during surgery, we want your blood to be able to clot because it helps stop any bleeding that might occur. Does that help clear things up?",
        "our_model": "I apologize if my explanation wasn't clear. When we say bleeding, we mean any loss of blood, including internal bleeding, which can occur during surgery. Blood thinners can make it harder for the blood to clot, which can lead to more bleeding. That's why they're usually stopped before surgery. Does that make more sense?"
