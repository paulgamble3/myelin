    "prompt": "Nurse: I mean that these medications can make it easier for you to bleed, or make bleeding more severe if it does occur. This is because they work by thinning your blood, which can be helpful in preventing blood clots, but not ideal during surgery. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Like, I I don't understand. Bleeding What do you mean?\n\nNurse: I apologize if my explanation wasn't clear. When we say bleeding, we mean any loss of blood, including internal bleeding, which can occur during surgery. Blood thinners can make it harder for the blood to clot, which can lead to more bleeding. That's why they're usually stopped before surgery. Does that make more sense?\n\nPatient: Guess so. I guess so. It makes more sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's move on to discuss how to prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Of course, darling. Kidding. I'm such a type of contract, you know, I've got it one time ago.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful to hear. You're well-prepared. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. After taking a normal shower and turning the water off, does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: You bet.",

        "gpt4": "Alright. After the shower, you'll want to apply the chlorhexidine scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and use it to gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's important to remember to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?",
