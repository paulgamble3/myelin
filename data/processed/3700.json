    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize if my explanation wasn't clear. When we say bleeding, we mean any loss of blood, including internal bleeding, which can occur during surgery. Blood thinners can make it harder for the blood to clot, which can lead to more bleeding. That's why they're usually stopped before surgery. Does that make more sense?\n\nPatient: Guess so. I guess so. It makes more sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's move on to discuss how to prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Of course, darling. Kidding. I'm such a type of contract, you know, I've got it one time ago.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful to hear. You're well-prepared. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. After taking a normal shower and turning the water off, does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: You bet.\n\nNurse: Excellent. After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's essential to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: What's the foil? I'm sorry. I need a scrub, so I can scrub it anywhere.",

        "gpt4": "That's a great question. The scrub is a type of antiseptic, and it can be too harsh for those sensitive areas like the face, hair, and crotch. It's best to only apply it from the neck down to ensure you don't cause any irritation. Does that make more sense?",
