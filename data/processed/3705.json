    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize if that wasn't clear. The chlorhexidine scrub is an antiseptic that helps reduce the risk of infection. It's meant to be used on your skin, but not on your face, hair, or crotch area. These areas can be more sensitive and may not need the scrub. Does that make more sense?\n\nPatient: Okay. Well, Whenever I'm taking shower, I'm just they can sell, like, a regular Paxton, but I guess\n\nNurse: Yes, that's correct. You'll use the chlorhexidine scrub after your regular shower. After applying it to a washcloth and gently scrubbing your skin, you'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes, then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: You know?\n\nNurse: Yes. You're correct. You should continue to cleanse your body as you normally would during your shower. The chlorhexidine scrub is an additional step to help prepare your skin for surgery. After applying the scrub, you'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes, then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: I mean, ma'am, I've taken out before my life. So I think I got it from here.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. I'm glad you're feeling confident about this. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub or the process of using it?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "our_model": "Alright. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?"
