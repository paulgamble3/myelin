This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Well, can you elaborate? On, like, what's the reason of not eating?\n\nNurse: Certainly.\n\nPatient: What's\n\nPatient: Why?\n\nNurse: That's a good question. The reason is to prevent any food or liquid from being accidentally inhaled during your anesthesia. This could cause serious complications. That's why it's important to follow this instruction very strictly. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Oh, Oh, yeah.",
