    "prompt": "Patient: Well, can you elaborate? On, like, what's the reason of not eating?\n\nNurse: Certainly.\n\nPatient: What's\n\nPatient: Why?\n\nNurse: That's a good question. The reason is to prevent any food or liquid from being accidentally inhaled during your anesthesia. This could cause serious complications. That's why it's important to follow this instruction very strictly. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Oh, Oh, yeah.\n\nNurse: I'm glad that makes sense. Now, I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a few more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Carry on. Carry on.",
