Do you have a favorite type of pasta or a favorite pasta dish?\n\nPatient: Yes. Cauliflower.\n\nNurse: Cauliflower is a great choice, Mr. Koroleva.\n\nPatient: Pasta. I love cauliflower pasta.\n\nNurse: Cauliflower pasta sounds delicious, Mr. Koroleva. It's a great choice for your low fiber diet. Do you usually prepare it in a specific way?\n\nPatient: Are you sure that that cauliflower is low fiber? I think it's pretty high in fiber.",

        "gpt4": "Ah, I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Koroleva. You're right. Although cauliflower is a vegetable, it's typically higher in fiber. For this period, it would be best to hold off on the cauliflower and perhaps focus on white pasta with a simple sauce. How does that sound?",
        "our_model": "You're correct, Mr. Koroleva. Cauliflower is high in fiber. I apologize for the confusion. It's best to avoid it in the days leading up to your colonoscopy. Do you have any other favorite low fiber foods?"
