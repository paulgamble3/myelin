But did you hear my question?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Odonnell, I didn't quite catch your question. Could you please repeat it?\n\nPatient: I said\n\nNurse: Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you. Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nPatient: is my diabetes going to affect my mental health? I've rent somewhere online that that could be an issue.\n\nNurse: That's a very important question, Ms. Odonnell. Diabetes can indeed affect mental health. High blood sugar levels can lead to feelings of fatigue, irritability, and even anxiety.

Diet: Try to eat a balanced diet with plenty of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Limit your intake of sugary drinks, as these can quickly raise your blood sugar levels.\n\n2. Exercise: Regular physical activity can help your body use insulin more effectively, which can lower your blood sugar.\n\n3. Medication: Ensure you are taking any prescribed diabetes medication as directed. If it's not working or causing side effects, please tell your doctor.\n\n4. Regular Check-ups: Keep your appointments with your healthcare providers. They are essential for catching and managing any potential issues early. \n\nRemember, creating a healthy routine takes time and it's okay to start small with one change at a time. Is there anything else that you would like to ask or is there another area you'd like to discuss?",
