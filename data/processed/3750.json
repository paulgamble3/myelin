    "prompt": "Nurse: Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you. Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nPatient: is my diabetes going to affect my mental health? I've rent somewhere online that that could be an issue.\n\nNurse: That's a very important question, Ms. Odonnell. Diabetes can indeed affect mental health. High blood sugar levels can lead to feelings of fatigue, irritability, and even anxiety. It's also important to note that managing a chronic condition like diabetes can also have an impact on mental health. It's a lot to handle. But remember, managing your blood sugar levels can help. Now, let's discuss some strategies to lower your blood sugar. Would you like to hear them?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Ms. Odonnell. One strategy is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating a variety of foods, such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. It's also important to limit foods high in sugar and unhealthy fats. Do you think this is something you can incorporate into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: What do you mean by unhealthy fats?\n\nNurse: Unhealthy fats are those that are typically solid at room temperature, like butter, lard, and shortening. They're also found in foods like fried foods, pastries, and some processed snacks. These fats can raise your cholesterol levels, which isn't good for your heart health. Does that help clarify things, Ms. Odonnell?\n\nPatient: Okay.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Ms. Odonnell. Another strategy is regular physical activity. You don't have to run a marathon, but try to get moving every day. This can be as simple as a 30-minute walk. How does that sound to you? Are you currently engaging in any physical activities?",
        "our_model": "Great, Ms. Odonnell. Another strategy is regular physical activity. Walking, swimming, or any other form of exercise can help lower your blood sugar levels.
