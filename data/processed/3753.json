    "prompt": "Nurse: Unhealthy fats are those that are typically solid at room temperature, like butter, lard, and shortening. They're also found in foods like fried foods, pastries, and some processed snacks. These fats can raise your cholesterol levels, which isn't good for your heart health. Does that help clarify things, Ms. Odonnell?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Great, Ms. Odonnell. Another strategy is regular physical activity. Walking, swimming, or any other form of exercise can help lower your blood sugar levels. It's recommended to aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Do you think you could incorporate some form of physical activity into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: I can try.\n\nNurse: That's all we can ask for, Ms. Odonnell. Trying is the first step. Remember, even small changes can make a big difference. Now, let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure measurement?\n\nPatient: Payment.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Odonnell, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: I didn't say anything.",
