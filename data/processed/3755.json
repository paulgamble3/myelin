    "prompt": "Nurse: That's all we can ask for, Ms. Odonnell. Trying is the first step. Remember, even small changes can make a big difference. Now, let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure measurement?\n\nPatient: Payment.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Odonnell, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: I didn't say anything.\n\nNurse: My apologies for the confusion, Ms. Odonnell. I was asking about your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure measurement?\n\nPatient: My blood pressure sure I took it this morning.\n\nNurse: That's great, Ms. Odonnell. Could you please tell me what the result was?\n\nPatient: Yes. It was eighty over one hundred.",

        "gpt4": "I'm sorry, Ms. Odonnell, could you please repeat that? Usually blood pressure readings are presented with the higher number first, such as '120 over 80'. Could you please confirm your blood pressure reading from this morning?",
        "our_model": "Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Odonnell. A blood pressure reading of 80 over 100 is within the normal range, which is good news. It's critical to keep monitoring it regularly. If you're open to it, I can share some suggestions about managing blood pressure. Would that be okay?"
