Give me a moment to check how I can best support you.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Odonnell, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please confirm if you're experiencing sudden vision loss?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not. Okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Odonnell. Now, let's move on to your recent blood tests and urine labs. Do you have any questions about them?\n\nPatient: Actually, I don't know what they are. Don't know what my results are.",

        "gpt4": "I see, Ms. Odonnell. Let's go over them together. We have the sodium (Na) level at 134 mEq/L which is within the normal range indicating your body's balance of water and types of electrolytes. Then, your potassium (K) is 3.4 mEq/L which is slightly below the preferred level indicating you may need more potassium in your diet. Do you follow so far?",
        "our_model": "That's perfectly I see, Ms. Odonnell. Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 134 mEq/L, potassium is 3.4 mEq/L, BUN is 7.10 mmol/L, creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL, GFR is 58 mL/min/1.73m2, and urine albumin is 154 mg/g. These tests help us understand how your kidneys are working. Do you have any specific questions about these results?"
