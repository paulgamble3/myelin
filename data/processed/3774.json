    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Odonnell, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please confirm if you're experiencing sudden vision loss?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not. Okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Odonnell. Now, let's move on to your recent blood tests and urine labs. Do you have any questions about them?\n\nPatient: Actually, I don't know what they are. Don't know what my results are.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly I see, Ms. Odonnell. Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 134 mEq/L, potassium is 3.4 mEq/L, BUN is 7.10 mmol/L, creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL, GFR is 58 mL/min/1.73m2, and urine albumin is 154 mg/g. These tests help us understand how your kidneys are working. Do you have any specific questions about these results?\n\nPatient: That's perfectly ideal. What are you talking about?\n\nNurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear, Ms. Odonnell. Sodium is a mineral that your body needs to function properly. The normal range is typically between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Your sodium level is 134 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Wait. What?",

        "gpt4": "I'm sorry, Ms. Odonnell, for the confusion. Sodium is a mineral that our bodies need to work correctly. It helps control blood pressure and supports the work of nerves and muscles. Your sodium level was 134 mEq/L, which is very close to the ideal range of 135 to 145 mEq/L. Is this information clear, or would you like me to explain it further?",
        "our_model": "I'm sorry for any confusion, Ms. Odonnell. Your sodium level is 134 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. This means your body has a good balance of this mineral. Do you have any questions about this?"
