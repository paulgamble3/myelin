    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Odonnell. Now, let's move on to your recent blood tests and urine labs. Do you have any questions about them?\n\nPatient: Actually, I don't know what they are. Don't know what my results are.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly I see, Ms. Odonnell. Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 134 mEq/L, potassium is 3.4 mEq/L, BUN is 7.10 mmol/L, creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL, GFR is 58 mL/min/1.73m2, and urine albumin is 154 mg/g. These tests help us understand how your kidneys are working. Do you have any specific questions about these results?\n\nPatient: That's perfectly ideal. What are you talking about?\n\nNurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear, Ms. Odonnell. Sodium is a mineral that your body needs to function properly. The normal range is typically between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Your sodium level is 134 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Wait. What?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry for any confusion, Ms. Odonnell. Your sodium level is 134 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. This means your body has a good balance of this mineral. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Okay, Ms. Odonnell. Now let's move to potassium. The normal range is usually between 3.6 and 5.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Your result is 3.4 mmol/L, which is slightly below the normal range. Potassium is an important mineral your body needs to work properly. It helps nerves and muscles communicate, and it also helps move nutrients into cells and waste products out of cells. Do you have any questions about this?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Ms. Odonnell. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Apixaban 5 mg oral tablet, 10 mg once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?"
