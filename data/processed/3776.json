    "prompt": "Patient: That's perfectly ideal. What are you talking about?\n\nNurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear, Ms. Odonnell. Sodium is a mineral that your body needs to function properly. The normal range is typically between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Your sodium level is 134 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Wait. What?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry for any confusion, Ms. Odonnell. Your sodium level is 134 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. This means your body has a good balance of this mineral. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Odonnell. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Apixaban 5 mg oral tablet, 10 mg once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Wait. Hang on. Did you give me my potassium levels? Because I heard that\n\nPatient: That's what I really need to watch out for.",

        "gpt4": "You're absolutely right, Ms. Odonnell, and I apologize for not providing that information earlier. Monitoring potassium levels is indeed important when managing kidney disease. The normal potassium level is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Your potassium level is 3.4 mEq/L. While this is slightly below the normal range, slight variations can occur. It would be best to discuss this with your doctor on whether any modifications are needed in your treatment plan. But for now, let's proceed with reviewing your medications. Is that okay?",
        "our_model": "Of course, Ms. Odonnell. Your potassium level is 3.4 mEq/L. The normal range is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Your potassium level is slightly lower than the normal range. Potassium is a mineral that's crucial for heart function and muscle contraction. It's essential to keep an eye on this. Do you have any questions about this?"
