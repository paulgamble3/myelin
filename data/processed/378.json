        "gpt4": "I'm here, Mr. Koroleva. I apologize if there was a pause. Let's move on to the next phase of your preparation: the bowel cleanse. This might sound a bit unpleasant, but it's a crucial part of preparing for your colonoscopy. Starting the day before your procedure, you'll need to follow a clear liquid diet and take a special laxative that we'll provide. This will clean out your colon so the doctor can see everything clearly. Do you have any questions about this bowel cleansing process?",

In addition to the changes in your diet, you'll also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?"
