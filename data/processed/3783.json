        "gpt4": "Your estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is a measure of how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. It's measured in milliliters per minute per 1.73 meters squared (mL/min/1.73m2). The higher the GFR, the better your kidneys are functioning. A GFR below 60 mL/min/1.73m2 for three or more months is a sign of chronic kidney disease. Your GFR is currently 58 mL/min/1.73m2, which is slightly below the normal range. This means that your kidneys may not be working as well as they should be. Your GFR will continue to be monitored to ensure your kidney health. Do you have any questions about this, Ms. Odonnell?",
        "our_model": "Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It measures how much blood passes through the glomeruli each minute. Glomeruli are the tiny filters in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. A GFR below 60 for three months or more may mean you have kidney disease. Your GFR is 58, which is slightly below the normal range. This is why it's important to manage your kidney disease. Do you have any questions about this?"
