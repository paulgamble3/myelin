It measures how much blood passes through the glomeruli each minute. Glomeruli are the tiny filters in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. A GFR below 60 for three months or more may mean you have kidney disease. Your GFR is 58, which is slightly below the normal range. This is why it's important to manage your kidney disease. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Odonnell. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Apixaban 5 mg oral tablet, 10 mg once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: No. No. I guess not. Thanks.",
