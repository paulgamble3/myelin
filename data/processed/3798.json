Could you please repeat what you had for lunch and dinner yesterday?\n\nPatient: Lazagna for dinner.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Odonnell.

Lasagna can be made healthier by using lean ground beef or turkey, and adding more vegetables like spinach, mushrooms, or bell peppers. It's also a good idea to limit the amount of cheese used. For the sauce, you can use a low-sodium option or make your own with fresh tomatoes. Would you like more suggestions like this?\n\nPatient: Well, that's a good suggestion. Why don't I start with that one?",
