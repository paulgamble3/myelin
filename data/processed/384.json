        "gpt4": "I'd be happy to explain that, Mr. Koroleva. The reason you take the NuLYTELY laxative solution both in the evening and in the morning is to ensure that your colon is completely clear of any waste. It's crucial for the colonoscopy that your colon is as clean as possible. Starting the laxative solution the evening before allows it to start working overnight. You'll then finish the process in the morning of your procedure. Does that help clarify things?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question, Mr. Koroleva. The NuLYTELY laxative solution is designed to clean out your colon. You'll start drinking it the night before your procedure, around 6 PM. Then, you'll wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish the second half of the solution. This timing ensures that your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. Does that help clarify things?"
