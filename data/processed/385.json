    "prompt": "Nurse: I can understand your feelings, Mr. Koroleva. It's not the most pleasant part of the process, but it's a crucial step to ensure your colonoscopy goes smoothly. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the prep?\n\nPatient: Can you tell me about it? There's specific\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Koroleva.\n\nPatient: instructions. Right? That seems like I have to take it in the morning and it's evening, and I don't understand why do I have to take it\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Koroleva.\n\nPatient: in the morning and evening.\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Koroleva. The NuLYTELY laxative solution is designed to clean out your colon. You'll start drinking it the night before your procedure, around 6 PM. Then, you'll wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish the second half of the solution. This timing ensures that your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: It does. Yes. And early morning, what time do I need to start this solution in the morning.",

        "gpt4": "That's an excellent question, Mr. Koroleva. The exact timing can vary, but a good rule of thumb is to allow at least 5 hours before your procedure. So, since your procedure is at 11am, you would want to finish the solution no later than 6am to allow your system enough time to clear. Is that clear?",
        "our_model": "You'll need to start drinking the second half of the NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6 AM, Mr. Koroleva. This will give it enough time to work before your procedure at 11 AM. Does that make sense?"
