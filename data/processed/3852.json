    "prompt": "Nurse: Great. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Jami Wyatt, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately?\n\nPatient: I'm I'm doing okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you're doing okay. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week?\n\nPatient: Maybe I'll meet up with some friends or something. Nothing specific, though.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a nice plan. It's always good to spend time with friends. Do you usually meet at a specific place or do you prefer to try out new places each time?\n\nPatient: Yeah. We can just go to wherever's trendy, I guess.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a fun approach. Trying out new places can be quite exciting. Before we move on, is there anything you've been feeling concerned about health-wise that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",
