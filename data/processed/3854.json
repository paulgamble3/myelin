    "prompt": "Nurse: That sounds like a nice plan. It's always good to spend time with friends. Do you usually meet at a specific place or do you prefer to try out new places each time?\n\nPatient: Yeah. We can just go to wherever's trendy, I guess.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a fun approach. Trying out new places can be quite exciting. Before we move on, is there anything you've been feeling concerned about health-wise that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I have.",
