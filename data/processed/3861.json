    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's talk about your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure measurement, and what was the result?\n\nPatient: It was ninety over one twenty.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's critical to keep your blood pressure under control. If you're open to it, I can share some suggestions to help manage your blood pressure. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. One way to manage your blood pressure is by reducing your salt intake. This can be achieved by eating less processed foods and not adding extra salt to your meals. Another strategy is to maintain a healthy weight. This can be done through a balanced diet and regular physical activity. Lastly, limiting alcohol and quitting smoking, if applicable, can also help manage your blood pressure. Do these suggestions sound manageable to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. They do.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What does GFR mean? And, like, how do you measure that.",

        "gpt4": "Good question. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test that tells us how well your kidneys are working. Essentially, it measures how much blood your kidneys filter per minute. The higher the number, the better your kidneys are functioning. Your recent GFR was 43 mL/min/1.73m2 which aligns with your current stage of Chronic Kidney Disease. Does that explanation make sense?",
        "our_model": "Great question. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A lower GFR can mean that your kidneys aren't working as well as they should be. Your GFR is 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which is a bit lower than normal. This is something your doctor will continue to monitor. Does that help clarify things?"
