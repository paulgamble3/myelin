        "gpt4": "It's great to hear you're committed to eating healthier and following the DASH diet, that's a really positive step. Salads can be a very nutritious part of your diet. As for the Wishbone Italian dressing, while it can add flavor, it's important to be mindful of the sodium content. Pre-made dressings can contain a high amount of sodium. May I suggest checking the nutritional label for the exact amount? Would you like some tips on other ways to flavor your salads that may be lower in sodium?",
