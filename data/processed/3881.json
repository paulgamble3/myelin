    "prompt": "Nurse: I appreciate your honesty. Quitting smoking is a big step and it's okay if you're not ready yet. Could you share with me why you feel you're not ready to quit at this time?\n\nPatient: Because I like it.\n\nNurse: I understand that it can be difficult to quit something that you enjoy. It's a personal decision and it's important to do what feels right for you. If you ever change your mind, I have lots of resources that could help you. Would you like me to share some of these resources with you?\n\nPatient: No. I don't wanna quit smoking.\n\nNurse: I respect your decision. It's critical to remember that if you ever change your mind, there are resources available to support you. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I have one more question. I wanted to know what can I do to prevent going on dialysis?\n\nNurse: That's a very important question. There are several things you can do to help slow the progression of kidney disease and potentially delay the need for dialysis. These include managing your blood sugar levels if you have diabetes, controlling your blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, and avoiding medications that can harm your kidneys. Regular check-ups with your doctor are also crucial. Do these suggestions sound manageable to you?\n\nPatient: That's fine, I guess.",
