Now, I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Ellie Ortega to discuss a few topics related to your health. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to your medications. Have you been able to pick up your new prescription for Lasix 20 mg oral tablets?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking the Lasix 20 mg tablets two times a day as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I am.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's critical to take your medications as prescribed to manage your CHF. Now, are you still taking your Valsartan?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
