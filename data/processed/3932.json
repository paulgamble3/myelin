It's critical to take your medications as prescribed to manage your CHF. Now, are you still taking your Valsartan?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great. It's important to continue taking your Valsartan as it helps manage your CHF. I understand that managing medications can sometimes be challenging. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time?\n\nPatient: No. I don't. Since I only have two medications that I take\n\nNurse: That's fantastic. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, with your permission, I'd like to ask a few questions about your symptoms to understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: both of them at the same time every day pretty easy so far.",
