Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I think I'm good. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Koroleva. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling good about the information we've covered so far. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness recently. Have you had any fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Koroleva. It's essential to be in good health before your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: My goodness. No. Do I need to I thought I'm gonna just walk.

        "gpt4": "I can understand your reasoning, Mr. Koroleva. However, after a colonoscopy, it's not advisable to drive or walk home yourself. This is because you'll receive sedation for the procedure and might not be fully alert afterwards. It's a safety precaution. If it's feasible, can you arrange for a trusted person to take you home after the procedure?",
        "our_model": "I understand your thinking, Mr. Koroleva. However, after a colonoscopy, you'll be given a sedative to help you relax during the procedure. This can make it unsafe for you to drive or walk home. It's important to have someone available to pick you up when the hospital calls. Do you have a friend or family member who could help with this?"
