Do you have any questions or concerns about the procedure that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. Please remember that you can ask me any questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained abdominal pain. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I just wanna get some answers\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Dang. It's completely normal to want answers about your health. I hope this procedure will provide you and your doctor with the information you're looking for. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on preparing for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent, thank you, Mr. Dang. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll also have another call the day before your procedure. Let's start with your current medication. You're taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great. Please continue taking your medication as prescribed, but we usually recommend to stop taking blood thinners a few days before the procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding. However, since every patient is different, it's crucial to discuss this with your healthcare provider. Have you already discussed your medication plan with your doctor in regards to the upcoming procedure?",
