    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. Please remember that you can ask me any questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained abdominal pain. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I just wanna get some answers\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Dang. It's completely normal to want answers about your health. I hope this procedure will provide you and your doctor with the information you're looking for. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on preparing for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent, thank you, Mr. Dang. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll also have another call the day before your procedure. Let's start with your current medication. You're taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming that, Mr. Dang. It's critical to discuss your medication in relation to your upcoming procedure. Have you been instructed to stop taking Xarelto before your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Hello?",
