    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful, Mr. Dang. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Dang. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Dang. As you mentioned earlier, you've been instructed to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Hello? Yes. I said yes.",
