    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay, Mr. Dang. As you mentioned earlier, you've been instructed to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Hello? Yes. I said yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming, Mr. Dang. As you mentioned earlier, you've been instructed to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Dang. Do you have any questions about stopping Xarelto or any other aspect of your medication?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. If you do have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: I am not.",

        "gpt4": "Great, thank you for the confirmation, Mr. Dang. If you were, typically those would also need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless otherwise recommended by your doctor. Do you have any further questions about medications before we move on to the next topic?",
        "our_model": "That's good to hear, Mr. Dang. It's essential to avoid those medications before your colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any other questions about medications?"
