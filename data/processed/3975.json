    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. If you do have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to discuss supplements. You will also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Dang. It's important to avoid those supplements and medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or any other aspect of your preparation?\n\nPatient: I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. If you do have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Well, it has to be done, so I'm going to do it.\n\nNurse: That's a positive attitude, Mr. Dang. It's true that the preparation is a crucial part of the procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about the clear liquid diet and the laxative solution?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect, Mr. Dang. It's important to know that you don't have to do anything just yet. You'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before the procedure. That means on August 16, you will switch to a clear liquid diet. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Does that sound clear to you?",

But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?"
