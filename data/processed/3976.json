    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Dang. It's important to avoid those supplements and medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or any other aspect of your preparation?\n\nPatient: I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. If you do have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Well, it has to be done, so I'm going to do it.\n\nNurse: That's a positive attitude, Mr. Dang. It's true that the preparation is a crucial part of the procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about the clear liquid diet and the laxative solution?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. If you do have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. Dang. Clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. You can also drink beverages like apple juice, lemonade, or white grape juice as long as they're not too sugary. Remember, no drinks with red or purple dye should be consumed as they can stain the colon and make it harder for the doctor to see during your procedure. What kind of questions do you have about this diet?",
        "our_model": "Okay, Mr. Dang. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any questions about these examples or any other clear liquids you're considering?"
