    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a positive attitude, Mr. Dang. It's true that the preparation is a crucial part of the procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about the clear liquid diet and the laxative solution?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. If you do have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Dang. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any questions about these examples or any other clear liquids you're considering?\n\nPatient: What?\n\nNurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear, Mr. Dang. I was saying that examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any questions about these examples or any other clear liquids you're considering?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Okay, Mr. Dang. If you have any questions later, feel free to ask. Now, do you have any strategies or personal routines to manage the clear liquid diet? Something like a specific drink you enjoy while on a clear liquid diet?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Dang. If you do have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?"
