    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear, Mr. Dang. I was saying that examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any questions about these examples or any other clear liquids you're considering?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Dang. If you do have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Dang. If you do have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Hello? Are you there?\n\nNurse: Yes, I'm here, Mr. Dang. I was saying that you will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Hello?",
