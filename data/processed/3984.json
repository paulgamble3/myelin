        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Dang. If any questions arise later, please don't hesitate to ask. I do want to clarify this as it's very important - you must stop all solid food and liquids at least 4 hours prior to your exam. You can take any necessary medication with a small sip of water within that 4 hours, but should otherwise consume nothing. Does that make sense to you, Mr. Dang?",

I just have 2 more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions about anything we've discussed so far?"
