    "prompt": "Patient: Chicken pot pie.\n\nNurse: Chicken pot pie sounds delicious, Ms. Warrell. It's a classic dish that always hits the spot. Do you have a special recipe that you follow or do you like to experiment with different ingredients?\n\nPatient: It's the same recipe over and over again.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Warrell. Sometimes, it's the familiarity and comfort of a tried-and-true recipe that makes it special. Now, I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Benson and I have a few topics to cover with you. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Warrell. Let's move on to your medications. I see that you don't have any new prescriptions, but I'd like to confirm that you're still taking your existing medications. Are you still taking Valsartan and Lasix?\n\nPatient: Yes. I am. Taking all my meds.\n\nPatient: Thank you for asking.",
