It's critical to have someone you trust to take you home after the procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the logistics of your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I do not.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over your medication changes, diet preparation, and the bowel prep with NuLYTELY. You've agreed to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure, start a low fiber diet today, and arrange for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
