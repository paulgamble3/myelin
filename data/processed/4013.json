        "gpt4": "Great, Ms. Warrell. According to what you've told me, it sounds like your CHF symptoms are under control. I would recommend that you continue to monitor these symptoms at home, just like the way we did now. I understand keeping track of all these symptoms can seem cumbersome. Do you have any questions on how to do so, or is there anything that you are not clear about?",
