    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Warrell. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Warrell. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No, ma'am.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Warrell. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep an eye on these symptoms at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Ms. Warrell. Could you please confirm whether you've been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: Of course.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad to hear that you've been able to maintain your usual sleep habits, Ms. Warrell. Using more pillows can sometimes be a sign of worsening heart failure, as it can indicate difficulty breathing while laying flat. However, since you're not experiencing this, it's a positive sign. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?",
