Could you please confirm whether you've been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: Of course.\n\nNurse: Give me a moment while I figure out how I can best help you. Give me a moment to check how I can best support you.\n\nPatient: No. I don't need extra kilos at night.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Warrell. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Okay.",
