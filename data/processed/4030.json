    "prompt": "Nurse: That sounds like a very nutritious and hearty meal, Ms. Warrell. It's great that you're focusing on vegetables and lean proteins. Do you usually follow a vegetarian diet?\n\nPatient: Oh,\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Warrell, I didn't quite catch the last vegetable you mentioned. Could you please repeat it?\n\nPatient: So so delicious.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a very nutritious and flavorful dish, Ms. Warrell. It's great that you're enjoying it. Now, I'd like to remind you of your dietary recommendations. You're following a cardiac diet, which means it's important to eat foods that are low in sodium, saturated fat, and cholesterol. Can I share some dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Sure. Yeah.\n\nNurse: Great, Ms. Warrell. For your cardiac diet, it's recommended to include a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. It's also important to limit your intake of sodium, saturated fats, and added sugars. How does this fit in with your current meals?\n\nPatient: What are the recommendations",

        "gpt4": "Sure, here are some recommendations for heart-healthy eating:\n\n1. Eat a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables. Aim for at least 5 portions a day. \n\n2. Choose whole grains instead of refined grain products. For example, opt for whole grain bread, brown rice, or whole grain pasta.\n\n3. Include a good source of lean protein in each meal, such as fish, poultry, beans, or nuts.\n\n4. Limit your intake of saturated and trans fats. These are found in fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, and many processed foods.\n\n5. Choose healthy fats, such as those found in olive oil, avocados, or fatty fish like salmon or mackerel.\n\n6. Limit your sodium intake. Aim for less than 2300 mg per day. \n\n7. Limit the amount of added sugars in your diet. This includes not only sugar, but also other sweeteners like honey and syrup.\n\nRemember, It's always best to eat a balance of different foods and not to rely on any one food or food group. The key to a healthy diet is variety and balance.",
