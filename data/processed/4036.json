    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Ms. Warrell. Could you please confirm whether you've been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: have this congestive heart failure,\n\nNurse: Yes, Ms. Warrell, managing your diet is an important part of managing CHF. It sounds like you're already making some good choices with the vegetarian dish you mentioned earlier. Just remember to keep an eye on the sodium content, as it can impact your CHF. Do you have any questions\n\nPatient: So it's not a problem.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Warrell. It sounds like you're already doing a good job following a cardiac diet. Remember, it's important to keep this up for your health. Now, let's talk about exercise. Could you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: To the kitchen from kitchen to the couch to the couch and backyard.\n\nNurse: It sounds like you're staying active around the house, Ms. Warrell. That's a good start. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Can I share these with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, please. Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great! Remember, it's important to start slow and gradually increase your activity as you gain strength. Even small activities like walking to the kitchen or backyard, as you mentioned, can be beneficial. \n\nIf you feel good with these activities, you could consider scheduling short, regular walks in your day, just at a pace that's comfortable for you. Make sure you have a place to rest along the way if needed, and always listen to your body. If you get too tired or short of breath, it's okay to take a break or stop. \n\nDo you have any questions or concerns about these exercise suggestions?",
        "our_model": "Wonderful, Ms. Warrell. It's recommended to start with light activities, such as walking or gentle stretching. You could start with a short walk around your house or yard, and gradually increase the distance as you feel comfortable. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. How does this sound to you?"
