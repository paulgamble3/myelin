    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Ms. Warrell, managing your diet is an important part of managing CHF. It sounds like you're already making some good choices with the vegetarian dish you mentioned earlier. Just remember to keep an eye on the sodium content, as it can impact your CHF. Do you have any questions\n\nPatient: So it's not a problem.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Warrell. It sounds like you're already doing a good job following a cardiac diet. Remember, it's important to keep this up for your health. Now, let's talk about exercise. Could you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: To the kitchen from kitchen to the couch to the couch and backyard.\n\nNurse: It sounds like you're staying active around the house, Ms. Warrell. That's a good start. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Can I share these with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, please. Sure.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Ms. Warrell. It's recommended to start with light activities, such as walking or gentle stretching. You could start with a short walk around your house or yard, and gradually increase the distance as you feel comfortable. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. How does this sound to you?\n\nPatient: I'm sorry.",
