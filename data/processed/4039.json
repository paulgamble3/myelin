    "prompt": "Nurse: It sounds like you're staying active around the house, Ms. Warrell. That's a good start. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Can I share these with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, please. Sure.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Ms. Warrell. It's recommended to start with light activities, such as walking or gentle stretching. You could start with a short walk around your house or yard, and gradually increase the distance as you feel comfortable. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. How does this sound to you?\n\nPatient: I'm sorry.\n\nNurse: No problem, Ms. Warrell. I understand that adjusting diet and exercise can be hard. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed?\n\nPatient: Say it again. What do you want me to do?\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Warrell. I'm suggesting that you start with light activities, such as walking or gentle stretching. You could begin with a short walk around your house or yard, and gradually increase the distance as you feel comfortable. It's critical to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Warrell, that's what I said. Then I told you that's what I'm doing.",
