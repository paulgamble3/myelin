What do you want me to do?\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Warrell. I'm suggesting that you start with light activities, such as walking or gentle stretching. You could begin with a short walk around your house or yard, and gradually increase the distance as you feel comfortable. It's critical to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard.
