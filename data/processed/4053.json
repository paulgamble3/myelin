Now, I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Ellie Ortega and I have a few topics to cover with you. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: And I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. Let's move on to your medications. Have you been able to pick up your new prescription for Lasix 20 mg oral tablets?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: Great, and how have you been taking your Lasix?\n\nPatient: Just fine.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Now, are you still taking your Valsartan?\n\nPatient: Mhmm.",
