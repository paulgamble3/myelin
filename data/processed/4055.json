Now, are you still taking your Valsartan?\n\nPatient: Mhmm.\n\nNurse: That's great. It's important to keep up with your medications. I understand that sometimes it can be challenging to remember to take them on time. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No. I'm pretty good about my routine.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
