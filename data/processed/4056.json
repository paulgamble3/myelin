Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No. I'm pretty good about my routine.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: No.",
