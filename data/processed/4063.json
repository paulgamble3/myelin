    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to do this at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be a bit complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No. That was all pretty straightforward.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's talk about your diet. Can you tell me about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: Well, I am on a ketogenic cardiac diet, and I wanna be honest, it's been stressful to follow such a strict diet. Don't even know what food that you need, that not only go with the diet, but also help manage my obesity and cardiac heart failure.",
