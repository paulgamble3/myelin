    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to include protein in your meals. Did you have any sides or vegetables with your chicken?\n\nPatient: No. Because I'm not sure what I'm allowed to eat on my diet.\n\nNurse: I see. It's important to remember that while on a ketogenic diet, you should focus on high-fat, low-carb foods. However, due to your CHF, it's also crucial to follow a cardiac low sodium diet. This means avoiding processed foods and adding less salt to your meals. Would it be okay if I shared some dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. Please tell me what to do so I can stay healthy.\n\nNurse: Absolutely. For your meals, try to include a variety of foods. For example, for breakfast, you could have eggs with a side of avocado. For lunch, you could have a salad with grilled chicken and a variety of low-sodium vegetables. For dinner, you could have a piece of grilled fish with a side of steamed vegetables. Snacks could include raw nuts or seeds. Remember, it's important to limit your fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day. This includes all fluids, not just water. Does this help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. A little bit.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it's okay to take small steps and gradually adjust your diet. It's not about perfection, but about progress. Now, let's talk about exercise. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I I like to go on walks in the park.",
