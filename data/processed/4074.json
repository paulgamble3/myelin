    "prompt": "Nurse: That's wonderful. Walking and playing sports like pickleball are great ways to stay active. It's essential to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Would it be okay if I shared some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Okay. It's recommended to engage in moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, like brisk walking, for at least 30 minutes most days of the week. If you're already doing this, you could consider gradually increasing the frequency or duration of your walks. It's also beneficial to include some strength training exercises, like lifting light weights or using resistance bands. Remember, it's important to start slow and gradually increase your activity level. Always listen to your body and rest if you need to. Does this sound manageable to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Remember, the goal is to gradually increase your activity level while listening to your body. It's okay to take breaks and rest when needed. I understand that adjusting diet and exercise can be hard. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright. I will inform Doctor Ortega about our conversation and how you're doing. Before we end the call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Nope.",
