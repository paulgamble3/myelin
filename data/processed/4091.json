    "prompt": "Patient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful. Regular exercise can really help manage your blood sugar levels. Now, let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was?\n\nPatient: One\n\nPatient: twenty over eighty.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. That's a good reading. It's essential to keep monitoring your blood pressure regularly. If it's not too much trouble, could you share why it's important to keep track of your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Because high blood pressure is bad.\n\nNurse: That's correct. High blood pressure can lead to serious health problems. It's great that you're aware of this. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done.

        "gpt4": "Potassium and sodium are both important electrolytes in your body that help regulate heart function and fluid balance. Your potassium level, which was 4.5 mEq/L, is within the normal range. This is good as it means your body has a balanced amount of this electrolyte to help your nerves and muscles function well. The sodium level, 137 mEq/L, is also within the normal range, which is critical for maintaining the fluid balance in your body. Do you need further clarification on this?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question. Sodium and potassium are both types of electrolytes, which are minerals in your body that have an electric charge. They are necessary for your body to function properly. Sodium helps control your body's fluid balance and also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Potassium helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, to function properly. Your sodium level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. It's critical to keep these levels balanced for your overall health. Does that help clarify things for you?"
