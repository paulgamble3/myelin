    "prompt": "Nurse: Your question about dialysis is an important one. Dialysis is typically considered when kidney function, measured by Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), drops to a certain level. Your current GFR is 28 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are not functioning at their full capacity, but it's not at a level where dialysis is typically considered. However, it's crucial to manage your health conditions and follow your doctor's advice to maintain your kidney function. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could provide some clarity. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently prescribed Metformin 500 mg once a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Taking your medication as prescribed is crucial in managing your conditions. Now, let's move on to the next medication. You're also prescribed Tylenol 500 mg, up to 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as directed?\n\nPatient: Yes. Am I able to take this from my pain?\n\nNurse: Yes, you can take Tylenol for pain as directed by your doctor. It's important to remember not to exceed the maximum daily dose of 3000 mg. If your pain persists or worsens, it's crucial to let your doctor know. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
