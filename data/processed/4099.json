    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, you can take Tylenol for pain as directed by your doctor. It's important to remember not to exceed the maximum daily dose of 3000 mg. If your pain persists or worsens, it's crucial to let your doctor know. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, let's discuss the last medication. You're prescribed Atorvastatin 40 mg once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's essential to take your medications as prescribed to manage your conditions effectively. Remember, there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for patients with chronic kidney disease to take. Always talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Low carb, low salt diet, and I was actually wondering What food should I eat considering I'm a stage four CKD patient?",

        "gpt4": "That's a good question and I'm glad you're considering what's best for your health. With stage four chronic kidney disease, it's generally recommended to follow a renal diet, a carbohydrate controlled diet of about 130 grams per day, and a sodium-limited diet with less than 2300 mg of sodium per day. Could I share more about these recommendations with you?",
        "our_model": "It's great to hear that you're following a low carb and low salt diet. As a Stage IV CKD patient, it's recommended to follow a diet that's low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. This includes foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains. Would it be okay if I provide some specific food recommendations?"
