Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nPatient: Can you tell me which diet should I be following with my condition?\n\nNurse: I'm glad you asked. As a CHF and CKD patient, it's important to follow a diet that's low in sodium and potassium. You're also on a vegetarian diet, which can be beneficial for your conditions. However, I would recommend discussing this with your dietician who can provide a more personalized plan. Would you like me to arrange a consultation with your dietician?\n\nPatient: Sure. Thank you.",
