I am.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to take your medications as prescribed. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take them on time?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Thank you. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",
