    "prompt": "Nurse: I can imagine it might seem a bit unusual at first.\n\nPatient: You know what I mean?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, it's a significant change. But remember, this change is for the better. It's a step towards reducing your pain and improving your mobility. Do you have any specific activities or hobbies that you're excited to get back to once you've recovered from your surgery?\n\nPatient: I mean, just the regular walking. Very simple.\n\nNurse: Walking is a wonderful activity, and it's something many of us take for granted. Being able to walk without pain is a goal worth striving for. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: Nothing nothing intense or anything like that. I'm pretty mellow.\n\nNurse: Walking is a wonderful activity, and being able to do it without pain is a goal worth striving for. It's the simple things that often bring us the most joy. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling alright. Doing okay.",
