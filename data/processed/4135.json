We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to do this at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you tell me about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: I had a salad. A few hours ago.\n\nPatient: A chicken salad.",
