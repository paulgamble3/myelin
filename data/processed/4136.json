I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you tell me about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: I had a salad. A few hours ago.\n\nPatient: A chicken salad.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a healthy choice. What kind of salad was it?\n\nPatient: A chicken salad?",

        "gpt4": "I see. As a reminder, your current dietary recommendations suggest a vegetarian, low-sodium diet to support your CHF and CKD. Given that, replacing the chicken with plant-based proteins might be a good idea moving forward. Would you like some suggestions on what you could use instead?",
