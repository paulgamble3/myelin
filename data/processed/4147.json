    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you. As a CHF and CKD patient, it's important to limit your intake of sodium and potassium. Also, as a vegetarian, you'll want to ensure you're getting enough protein. Are you currently taking any supplements to help with this?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: Alright. It might be beneficial to discuss this with your dietician. They can provide more personalized advice. Now, let's talk about your exercise routine. Could you tell me about your current routine?\n\nPatient: I go for a walk everyday for thirty minutes.\n\nNurse: That's great! Regular walking is a good way to stay active. Do you usually walk at a steady pace or do you vary your speed?\n\nPatient: I work at a steady pace.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to keep a steady pace to ensure you're getting a good workout without overexerting yourself. Now, I'd like to provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's fine.",

        "gpt4": "Great. It's wonderful that you're already walking daily. An additional option you may want to consider is adding some light resistance training to your routine. This can be done with small weights or even household objects, and can be very beneficial for your overall health. However, always consult with your doctor before starting a new workout regimen. How's that sound to you?",

This could be as simple as lifting small weights or using resistance bands. However, it's important to start slow and gradually increase your activity level. Does that sound doable to you?"
