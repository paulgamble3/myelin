    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you. It's great that you're already walking daily. You might consider adding some light strength training exercises to your routine. This could be as simple as lifting small weights or using resistance bands. However, it's important to start slow and gradually increase your activity level. Does that sound doable to you?\n\nPatient: Yes. It is.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Adjusting diet and exercise can be hard. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'll be sure to inform Doctor Benson about our conversation and how you're doing. Before we end the call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. To summarize, you've agreed to continue your daily walks and consider adding some light strength training exercises to your routine. You're also going to discuss your diet with your dietician. Can I confirm that you're comfortable with these changes?\n\nPatient: Yes. I'm comfortable. Thank you.",
