I understand that you're on a low salt, low phosphorus diet. This is important for managing your kidney disease. Let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure measurement?\n\nPatient: This morning.\n\nNurse: Thank you for that information, Mr. Peck. Could you please tell me what the result of your blood pressure measurement was this morning?\n\nPatient: It was one twenty over sixty.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Peck. That's a good blood pressure reading. It's important to keep it under control. Can I share some suggestions about managing blood pressure?\n\nPatient: No. Thank you.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Peck. If you ever have any questions or need any suggestions, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yes. What were my sodium and creating levels.",

        "gpt4": "Your sodium level was 141 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L), which is well within the normal range. Sodium is an important electrolyte in your body that helps maintain fluid balance. \n\nYour creatinine level was 0.85 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Creatinine is a waste product that your kidneys filter out of your blood. This level is also within the normal range, which is a good sign for your kidney function. \n\nDo these findings make sense to you, Mr. Peck, or do you have any more questions about them?",
