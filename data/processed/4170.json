    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for that information, Mr. Peck. Could you please tell me what the result of your blood pressure measurement was this morning?\n\nPatient: It was one twenty over sixty.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Peck. That's a good blood pressure reading. It's important to keep it under control. Can I share some suggestions about managing blood pressure?\n\nPatient: No. Thank you.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Peck. If you ever have any questions or need any suggestions, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yes. What were my sodium and creating levels.\n\nNurse: Your sodium level was 141 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your creatinine level was 0.85 mg/dL, also within the normal range. These levels are good indicators of your kidney function. Do you have any other questions about your lab results, Mr. Peck?\n\nPatient: No. Thank you. I I think I understand everything. Thank you.",
