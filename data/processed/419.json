Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: It's totally okay. Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Does that timing work for you?\n\nPatient: That's okay. Yep. That sounds good.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Sound good?",
