Have you ever considered quitting smoking?\n\nPatient: So\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Peck, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: Yes. But I'm not ready to do that now.\n\nNurse: That's completely okay, Mr. Peck. It's a big step to decide to quit smoking. Can you share with me why you feel you're not ready to quit at this time?\n\nPatient: Because I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly okay, Mr. Peck. It's a personal decision and it's important that you feel ready. If you ever change your mind, I have a lot of resources that I could share with you to help you quit. Would you like me to share some of these resources now, or would you prefer to wait until you're ready?\n\nPatient: I'm gonna wait until I'm ready.",
