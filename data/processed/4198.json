    "prompt": "Nurse: That's completely okay, Mr. Peck. It's a big step to decide to quit smoking. Can you share with me why you feel you're not ready to quit at this time?\n\nPatient: Because I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly okay, Mr. Peck. It's a personal decision and it's important that you feel ready. If you ever change your mind, I have a lot of resources that I could share with you to help you quit. Would you like me to share some of these resources now, or would you prefer to wait until you're ready?\n\nPatient: I'm gonna wait until I'm ready.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Peck. Whenever you feel ready, know that I'm here to provide you with resources and support. Now, let's move on to the next topic. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: Yes. Are there any habits that I should adopt to prevent going on dialysis.\n\nNurse: That's a very important question, Mr. Peck. There are several habits that can help manage your kidney disease and potentially delay the need for dialysis. These include maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking and alcohol. It's also crucial to manage any other health conditions you have, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, as they can impact your kidney health. Would you like me to provide more detailed information on any of these habits?\n\nPatient: No. I understand.",
