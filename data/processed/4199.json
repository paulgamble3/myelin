If you ever change your mind, I have a lot of resources that I could share with you to help you quit. Would you like me to share some of these resources now, or would you prefer to wait until you're ready?\n\nPatient: I'm gonna wait until I'm ready.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Peck. Whenever you feel ready, know that I'm here to provide you with resources and support. Now, let's move on to the next topic. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: Yes. Are there any habits that I should adopt to prevent going on dialysis.\n\nNurse: That's a very important question, Mr. Peck.
