    "prompt": "Nurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Peck. Whenever you feel ready, know that I'm here to provide you with resources and support. Now, let's move on to the next topic. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?\n\nPatient: Yes. Are there any habits that I should adopt to prevent going on dialysis.\n\nNurse: That's a very important question, Mr. Peck. There are several habits that can help manage your kidney disease and potentially delay the need for dialysis. These include maintaining a healthy diet, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, and avoiding smoking and alcohol. It's also crucial to manage any other health conditions you have, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, as they can impact your kidney health. Would you like me to provide more detailed information on any of these habits?\n\nPatient: No. I understand.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you understand, Mr. Peck. If you have any other questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I believe we've covered all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No, ma'am.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Peck. To summarize, you've agreed to continue taking your medications as prescribed, maintain your low salt and low phosphorus diet, and keep managing your blood sugar levels. Can I count on you to continue doing these things?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
