        "gpt4": "You are correct, Ms. Odonnell. High levels of potassium, a condition known as hyperkalemia, can indeed be harmful. It can cause irregular heart rhythms and muscle weakness. Fortunately, your recent lab results show your potassium level to be within a healthy range at 3.4 mEq/L. Do you have any other questions about your lab results?",
