        "our_model": "That's a great question, Ms. Odonnell. Your recent lab results show that your potassium level is 3.4 mEq/L. The normal range for potassium is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 mEq/L, so your level is within the normal range. It's critical to keep an eye on this because high potassium levels can be harmful, especially for people with kidney disease. Does that answer your question?"
