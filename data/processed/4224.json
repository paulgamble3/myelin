    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Yes, Ms. Odonnell, you're correct. Potassium is a mineral that's crucial for your body's functioning, but when it gets too high, it can be harmful, especially for people with kidney disease. Your recent potassium level was 3.4 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. It's critical to keep an eye on this, as a high potassium level can lead to heart rhythm problems. Do you have any other questions about your lab results?\n\nPatient: I wanna know where my potassium is\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Ms. Odonnell. Your recent lab results show that your potassium level is 3.4 mEq/L. The normal range for potassium is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 mEq/L, so your level is within the normal range. It's critical to keep an eye on this because high potassium levels can be harmful, especially for people with kidney disease. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: and I also want to know what GFR means for my kidney.\n\nNurse: Great questions, Ms. Odonnell. Your potassium level is currently 3.4 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Potassium is a mineral that helps your\n\nPatient: Disease.\n\nNurse: Great questions, Ms. Odonnell. Your potassium level is currently 3.4 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Potassium is an important mineral that helps your nerves and muscles work properly. However, when the kidneys aren't working well, they can't remove excess potassium, and levels can become too high, which can be harmful. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. Your GFR is currently 58 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are not filtering your blood as well as they should be. This is consistent with your diagnosis of Stage IIIA Chronic Kidney Disease. Does this help clarify these results for you, Ms. Odonnell?\n\nPatient: I think I'm seeing dialysis in my future, and I sure hope not.",

        "gpt4": "I understand that dialysis can seem very daunting, Ms. Odonnell. The aim right now is to slow down the progression of the kidney disease, and depending on various factors, there may be other options available for you before considering dialysis. I would like to review your medications now, if that's okay with you?",
        "our_model": "I understand your concerns, Ms. Odonnell. While it's true that kidney function may decline over time with chronic kidney disease, it's important to remember that many people with Stage IIIA CKD do not progress to needing dialysis. Managing your health conditions and following your treatment plan can help slow the progression of the disease. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Apixaban 5 mg oral tablet, 10 mg once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?"
