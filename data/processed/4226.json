Potassium is an important mineral that helps your nerves and muscles work properly. However, when the kidneys aren't working well, they can't remove excess potassium, and levels can become too high, which can be harmful. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. Your GFR is currently 58 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are not filtering your blood as well as they should be. This is consistent with your diagnosis of Stage IIIA Chronic Kidney Disease. Does this help clarify these results for you, Ms. Odonnell?\n\nPatient: I think I'm seeing dialysis in my future, and I sure hope not.\n\nNurse: I understand your concerns, Ms. Odonnell. While it's true that kidney function may decline over time with chronic kidney disease, it's important to remember that many people with Stage IIIA CKD do not progress to needing dialysis. Managing your health conditions and following your treatment plan can help slow the progression of the disease. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Apixaban 5 mg oral tablet, 10 mg once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I am taking the epixaban five milligrams. Ten milligrams once daily.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Ms. Odonnell. Sticking to your medication schedule is crucial for managing your health conditions. Now, let's move on to the next medication. You're also prescribed Lantus 100 IU/mL prefilled pen, with a dosage of 10 units every night at bedtime. Have you been taking this medication as directed?\n\nPatient: I have. Yes.",
