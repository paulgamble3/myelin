        "gpt4": "Thank you for bringing this up, Ms. Odonnell. Phosphorus is a mineral found in many foods. In healthy kidneys, extra phosphorus is filtered out, but when you have CKD, phosphorus can build up in your blood, causing weak bones, heart problems, and other health issues. Therefore, a diet low in phosphorus is often recommended for people with CKD. Do you need any tips on how to manage your phosphorus intake?",
        "our_model": "apologize for I apologize for the repetition, Ms. Odonnell. Phosphorus is a mineral that's important for your body, but when you have CKD, your kidneys can't remove excess phosphorus effectively. This can lead to high levels in your blood, which can cause damage to your body. It's often recommended for people with CKD to limit foods high in phosphorus, such as dairy products, beans, lentils, nuts, and whole grains. However, it's always best to consult with your doctor or a dietitian for personalized advice. Would you like me to note this for your care team to discuss further with you?"
