    "prompt": "Nurse: I appreciate your time and openness during our conversation today, Ms. Odonnell. It's been helpful in understanding your current health status. Remember, it's important to keep up with your medication schedule, monitor your blood sugar and blood pressure regularly, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to reach out. Take care. [\n\nPatient: Because that's what I was told to watch.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Ms. Odonnell. Monitoring your blood sugar and blood pressure regularly is indeed very important, especially with your conditions. It's great to hear that you're keeping track of these. Now, I'd like to remind you that there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for CKD patients to take. It's always best to talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: I don't. You just repeated yourself. I asked you about phosphorus\n\nNurse: I\n\nPatient: in my diet.\n\nNurse: apologize for I apologize for the repetition, Ms. Odonnell. Phosphorus is a mineral that's important for your body, but when you have CKD, your kidneys can't remove excess phosphorus effectively. This can lead to high levels in your blood, which can cause damage to your body. It's often recommended for people with CKD to limit foods high in phosphorus, such as dairy products, beans, lentils, nuts, and whole grains. However, it's always best to consult with your doctor or a dietitian for personalized advice. Would you like me to note this for your care team to discuss further with you?\n\nPatient: I can't hear you.",
