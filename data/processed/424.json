    "prompt": "Patient: Am looking forward to the surgery deleted or not. I've been getting ready.\n\nNurse: That's a great attitude to have. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes, please. Yes.\n\nPatient: What about medication?\n\nNurse: Wonderful. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Plavix 75 mg once a day. As per the instructions, you were told to stop this medication 7 days prior to the procedure. Have you already stopped taking Plavix?\n\nPatient: Yes. Yes. Wait. Plavix.\n\nNurse: Yes, Plavix. You've confirmed that you've stopped taking it, correct?\n\nPatient: Have I started",

        "gpt4": "I see, perhaps there's been some confusion. The instructions were to cease taking the Plavix medication 7 days prior to your surgery. Today would be the 3rd day before your surgery, which means you should have stopped taking Plavix 4 days ago. Can you confirm if you have done so?",
        "our_model": "I apologize for any confusion."
