    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Shyam, could you please repeat your favorite book by Stephen King?\n\nPatient: Oh, I I couldn't choose. You know?\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Shyam. Stephen King has such a vast collection, it's hard to pick just one. Now, I have a few topics to cover with you on behalf of Doctor Rodriguez. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: Nope. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Shyam. Let's start with your medications. Are you still taking your Valsartan and Lasix as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yep. I am.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Shyam. It's critical to keep up with your medications. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take them on time?\n\nPatient: Every once in a while, I guess.",
