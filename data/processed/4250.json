    "prompt": "Nurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Shyam. Stephen King has such a vast collection, it's hard to pick just one. Now, I have a few topics to cover with you on behalf of Doctor Rodriguez. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: Nope. I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Shyam. Let's start with your medications. Are you still taking your Valsartan and Lasix as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yep. I am.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Shyam. It's critical to keep up with your medications. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take them on time?\n\nPatient: Every once in a while, I guess.\n\nNurse: It's quite common to occasionally forget, Mr. Shyam. Would it be alright if I shared some strategies that might help you remember to take your medications on time?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Excellent, Mr. Shyam. One suggestion is to pair taking your medication with a daily activity, such as having a meal or brushing your teeth. This way, the activity acts as a reminder for your medication. Additionally, you may find benefit in using a pill box organizer. They have compartments for each day and time, which could make things easier and more organized for you. Moreover, setting an alarm can also be helpful. Do you think these strategies might work for you?",
        "our_model": "Great, Mr. Shyam. One strategy could be setting reminders on your phone or a clock. Another could be associating taking your medication with a daily routine, like brushing your teeth or having a meal. Would any of these strategies work for you?"
