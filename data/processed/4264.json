    "prompt": "Nurse: It sounds like you're making a conscious effort to eat healthily, Mr. Shyam. That's great. Do you mind if I share some dietary recommendations that could help manage your CHF, CKD, and Galactosemia?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Shyam. Given your conditions, it's important to follow a cardiac diet, which means limiting sodium and fluids. It's also crucial to follow a renal diet, which involves limiting potassium, phosphorus, and sodium. Lastly, due to your Galactosemia, you need to restrict lactose and galactose. Based on what you've shared about your diet, it seems like you're on the right track. Just remember to keep an eye on your sodium and fluid intake. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: Additionally, due to your Galactosemia, it's important to restrict lactose and galactose in your diet. This means avoiding dairy products and certain fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about these dietary recommendations, Mr. Shyam?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Shyam. Based on what you've shared about your diet, it seems like you're already making some good choices. One suggestion could be to incorporate more non-dairy sources of calcium, like almonds or broccoli, into your meals. Would you be open to trying this?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I can do that.",
