    "prompt": "Nurse: Additionally, due to your Galactosemia, it's important to restrict lactose and galactose in your diet. This means avoiding dairy products and certain fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about these dietary recommendations, Mr. Shyam?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Shyam. Based on what you've shared about your diet, it seems like you're already making some good choices. One suggestion could be to incorporate more non-dairy sources of calcium, like almonds or broccoli, into your meals. Would you be open to trying this?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I can do that.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Shyam. Remember, these changes can take time and it's okay to make them gradually. Now, let's talk about your exercise routine. Could you tell me about your current routine?\n\nPatient: I go on a couple of walks a week. That's kind of my main source.\n\nNurse: That's a good start, Mr. Shyam. Walking is a great low-impact exercise. Do you mind if I provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "That's great, Mr. Shyam. One suggestion could be to try and gradually increase the number of days you go for a walk, aiming for a goal of five days a week. Start slow and gradually build up as your stamina improves. Do you think this could work for you?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Shyam. It's important to gradually increase your activity level as your strength and endurance improve. This could mean adding an extra walk each week or extending the length of your walks. It's also beneficial to incorporate some light strength training exercises, like lifting small weights or using resistance bands. Remember, it's always important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does this sound manageable to you?"
