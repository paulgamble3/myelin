    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. Lastly, it's important to take your prescribed medication, Losartan, as directed by your doctor. Are you taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I am.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Taking your medication as prescribed is crucial in managing your blood pressure. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yes. About my sodium and my\n\nPatient: Click create name.\n\nPatient: Level?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: Can you explain that?",

        "gpt4": "Of course. Sodium levels in the blood need to be in balance for your cells to work properly. High or low sodium, also known as hypernatremia or hyponatremia, can cause symptoms like confusion, seizures and even coma in extreme cases.\n\nCreatinine is a waste product from the normal breakdown of muscles in your body. Your kidneys filter it from your blood and remove it in your urine. A high creatinine level may indicate a problem with kidney function. Having blood and urine test done periodically allows doctor and you to keep an eye on these levels and adjust your treatment plan if needed. \n\nDid I answer your question?",
        "our_model": "Of course. Your sodium level, which is a measure of the amount of salt in your body, is 141 mEq/L. This is within the normal range, which means your body has a good balance of salt. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 88 mL/min/1.73m2. This is a measure of how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. A higher number is better. Your result is slightly lower than the ideal range, which is something your doctor may be monitoring. Does that help clarify these results for you?"
