    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. Taking your medication as prescribed is crucial in managing your blood pressure. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yes. About my sodium and my\n\nPatient: Click create name.\n\nPatient: Level?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: Can you explain that?\n\nNurse: Of course. Your sodium level, which is a measure of the amount of salt in your body, is 141 mEq/L. This is within the normal range, which means your body has a good balance of salt. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 88 mL/min/1.73m2. This is a measure of how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. A higher number is better. Your result is slightly lower than the ideal range, which is something your doctor may be monitoring. Does that help clarify these results for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does.",
