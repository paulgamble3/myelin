    "prompt": "Patient: Click create name.\n\nPatient: Level?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: Can you explain that?\n\nNurse: Of course. Your sodium level, which is a measure of the amount of salt in your body, is 141 mEq/L. This is within the normal range, which means your body has a good balance of salt. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 88 mL/min/1.73m2. This is a measure of how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. A higher number is better. Your result is slightly lower than the ideal range, which is something your doctor may be monitoring. Does that help clarify these results for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. If you have any other questions about your lab results, feel free to ask. Now, let's review your medications. You're currently taking Losartan 25 mg oral tablet, 50 mg once a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.",
