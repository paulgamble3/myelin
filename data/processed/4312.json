    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, but as an AI, I don't have real-time information on the exact sodium content of specific foods or products. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label on the product for the most accurate information. Would you like some general tips on how to reduce sodium in your diet?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. One way to reduce sodium is to use herbs and spices instead of salt to flavor your food. Another is to choose fresh or frozen vegetables instead of canned ones, as canned vegetables often have added sodium. When you do use canned vegetables, rinsing them before eating can help remove some of the sodium. Does this sound manageable to you?\n\nPatient: Yes. I know.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?\n\nPatient: Yes. It is.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Remember, these changes can really help manage your sodium intake. Now, let's talk about your phosphorus intake. It's recommended that you limit your phosphorus intake to 0.8 grams per day. This can be achieved by limiting foods high in phosphorus, such as dairy products, beans, and nuts. Have you been able to follow this recommendation?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.",

Despite having kidney disease, it's important to get enough protein. However, more is not always better, because too much protein can put a strain on your kidneys. Have you been able to manage your protein intake?",
