        "gpt4": "Your blood sugar level of 112 mg/dL is within a fairly normal range for fasting blood sugar. However, you may start to experience symptoms of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) if your blood sugar consistently stays above 130 mg/dL when fasting. On the other hand, levels below 70 mg/dL are considered low and may lead to hypoglycemia. Continue to monitor this number and inform your doctor if there are any significant changes. If you do experience symptoms of high or low blood sugar, you should seek immediate medical care. Would you like a reminder of these symptoms?",
