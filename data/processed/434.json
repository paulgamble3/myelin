        "gpt4": "I'm glad you asked. Tylenol, also known as acetaminophen, is used to relieve mild to moderate pain from headaches, muscle aches, menstrual periods, colds, and fevers, and to reduce fever. Tramadol, on the other hand, is a stronger pain reliever. It's used to treat moderate to severe pain, such as the pain you might feel after surgery. Tramadol operates by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain. Would you like more information on these or any other medications?",
        "our_model": "Of course."
