    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Oliver. One way to manage blood pressure is by reducing sodium intake. This can be achieved by eating less processed foods and adding less salt to meals. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: That's fine.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Oliver. Another suggestion is to incorporate more physical activity into your daily routine. This could be as simple as taking a walk after meals. Do you think you could try that?\n\nPatient: Yes. I think I can try that.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Oliver. Regular physical activity can really make a difference. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What does the GFR mean?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr.\n\nPatient: And how is it measured?",

        "gpt4": "Good questions, Mr. Oliver. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. This is a test that measures how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. The kidneys filter waste and excess substances from the blood, and the GFR is the amount of blood that gets cleaned by the kidneys each minute. For example, a GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range, a GFR less than 60 for three months or more indicates that the kidneys aren't working as well as they should, and a GFR of 15 or lower means that the kidneys are barely working or failing. Your GFR is 67, which falls within the normal range. Does that help answer your questions?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question, Mr. Oliver. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A lower GFR can be a sign that your kidneys are not working as well as they should. Your GFR is 67 mL/min/1.73m2, which is within the normal range. Does that help clarify things for you?"
