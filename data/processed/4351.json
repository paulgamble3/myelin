    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Oliver. Another suggestion is to incorporate more physical activity into your daily routine. This could be as simple as taking a walk after meals. Do you think you could try that?\n\nPatient: Yes. I think I can try that.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Oliver. Regular physical activity can really make a difference. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What does the GFR mean?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr.\n\nPatient: And how is it measured?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Oliver. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A lower GFR can be a sign that your kidneys are not working as well as they should. Your GFR is 67 mL/min/1.73m2, which is within the normal range. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
