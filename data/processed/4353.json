    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great question, Mr.\n\nPatient: And how is it measured?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Oliver. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A lower GFR can be a sign that your kidneys are not working as well as they should. Your GFR is 67 mL/min/1.73m2, which is within the normal range. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Oliver. If you have any other questions about your lab results, feel free to ask. Otherwise, I'd like to discuss your medications. Is that alright with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Oliver. Let's start with your Valsartan. You're prescribed to take a 40 mg oral tablet daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
