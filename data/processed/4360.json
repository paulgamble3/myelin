    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Oliver. Now, I'd like to talk about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm trying to eat healthier, and I started eating a lot of salad.\n\nNurse: That's fantastic, Mr. Oliver! Eating salads can be a great way to incorporate more vegetables into your diet. What kinds of dressings and toppings are you using on your salads?\n\nPatient: I'm using the Wishbone Italian salad dressing. How much salt is in that dressing?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Oliver. I don't have the exact sodium content of Wishbone Italian salad dressing at the moment. However, many salad dressings can be high in sodium. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label on the bottle. Would you like some suggestions on how to make your salads even healthier?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Oliver. One suggestion is to consider using a light or reduced-sodium version of your favorite salad dressing. You could also try making your own dressing at home with olive oil, vinegar, and your favorite herbs and spices. This way, you can control the amount of sodium in your dressing. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's a good idea.",
