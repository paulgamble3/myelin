        "our_model": "Absolutely, let me explain. Tylenol is a pain reliever and is often used to manage mild to moderate pain. It's often used after surgery to help manage any discomfort you might experience. Tramadol, on the other hand, is a stronger pain reliever. It's typically used for more severe pain and is often prescribed after surgeries like yours. Does that help clarify things for you?"
