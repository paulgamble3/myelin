        "gpt4": "Great, thank you for confirming your medications. Now, I want to clarify your Tylenol dosage. You should be taking two 500 mg tablets for a total of 1000 mg, up to three times a day as needed, not just \"up to three times a day\" without specifying the 1000 mg dose. Did you understand these instructions clearly?",
        "our_model": "I apologize for the oversight earlier. Are you taking your Tylenol 500 mg oral tablets, with a dosage of 1000 mg, three times a day as needed?"
