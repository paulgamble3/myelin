        "gpt4": "Great. It's important to always take medications as recommended by your doctor. If you're taking Tylenol 500mg tablets, you should be taking two tablets at each dose to make a total of 1000mg, up to three times a day. This is not just \"up to three times a day\" without specifying the 1000 mg dose. Can you confirm that this is how you've been taking it?",
        "our_model": "That's excellent. It's essential to take your medications as prescribed. I understand that sometimes it can be challenging to remember all the doses and timings. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?"
