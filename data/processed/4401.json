    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Trisha, you were saying something about your feelings towards the upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: I'm doing fine. Yeah. A little anxious. To be honest. Mostly not about the procedure, but about afterwards, needed, like, how much help I'm gonna need? Testing, but\n\nNurse: It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious, especially about the recovery period. Rest assured, you will have a team of healthcare professionals, including Doctor Stevens, your surgeon, and myself, your AI nurse, to support you every step of the way. Before we delve into the details, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I wanna know if it's gonna be super difficult to walk out for the surgery.\n\nNurse: That's a very valid concern. After a total knee replacement, it's normal to need some assistance with walking initially. The exact amount of help needed can vary from person to person, but you will have physical therapy and nursing staff to support you. Over time, as your knee heals and strengthens, you'll regain your mobility. Does that help address your concern?\n\nPatient: I guess so. Yeah. Thanks.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
