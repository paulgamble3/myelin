    "prompt": "Nurse: Great. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Plavix 75 mg once a day. As per the instructions, you were told to stop this medication 7 days prior to the procedure. Have you already stopped taking Plavix?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to follow these instructions for your surgery. Do you have any questions about Plavix or why it was necessary to stop it before your procedure?\n\nPatient: No.",
