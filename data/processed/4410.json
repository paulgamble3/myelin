    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to follow these instructions for your surgery. Do you have any questions about Plavix or why it was necessary to stop it before your procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to avoid those medications before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol and Tramadol for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I have.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's critical to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or their usage?\n\nPatient: No.",
