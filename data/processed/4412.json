    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to avoid those medications before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol and Tramadol for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I have.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's critical to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or their usage?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. The chlorhexidine scrub is an important part of preparing for your surgery. Let's go over the instructions for using it. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yep.",

        "gpt4": "Great! After showering, wet a clean washcloth, then apply the chlorhexidine scrub and wash yourself from the neck down. Please avoid scrubbing it on your face, hair or the crotch area. Are you comfortable with this step?",
