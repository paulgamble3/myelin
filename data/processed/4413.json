    "prompt": "Nurse: That's excellent. It's critical to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or their usage?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. The chlorhexidine scrub is an important part of preparing for your surgery. Let's go over the instructions for using it. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Perfect. After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
