It's important to have a comfortable and safe place to recover after your procedure. Now, my last question is about your transportation and support at home. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to arrange or if you have any questions, feel free to let me know. We're here to support you. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. That was all the topics for today.

        "gpt4": "Great. I'd like to summarize what you still need to do before your procedure. Remember to stop eating or drinking anything after midnight before your surgery. You should shower the night before and the morning of the surgery using the chlorhexidine scrub. Please ensure to have someone ready to pick you up and stay with you at home following the procedure. Can I count on you to complete all of these tasks?",
