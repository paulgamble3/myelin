    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent. It's important to have a comfortable and safe place to recover after your procedure. Now, my last question is about your transportation and support at home. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to arrange or if you have any questions, feel free to let me know. We're here to support you. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. That was all the topics for today. Before we end this call, do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Okay. To summarize, before your procedure, remember to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Also, remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]",
