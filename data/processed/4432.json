There's no place like home, after all. By the way, do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy?\n\nPatient: Oh, I don't know. I I like knitting.\n\nNurse: Knitting is a wonderful hobby, Mr. Delarosa. It's therapeutic and can be quite relaxing. What do you usually knit?\n\nPatient: Socks.\n\nNurse: That's impressive, Mr. Delarosa. Knitting socks requires a lot of skill and patience.
