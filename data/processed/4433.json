I I like knitting.\n\nNurse: Knitting is a wonderful hobby, Mr. Delarosa. It's therapeutic and can be quite relaxing. What do you usually knit?\n\nPatient: Socks.\n\nNurse: That's impressive, Mr. Delarosa. Knitting socks requires a lot of skill and patience. Do you have a favorite pair that you've made?\n\nPatient: No. I like them all.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Delarosa. It's great to hear that you enjoy your hobby. Now, I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Gervais and I have a few topics to cover with you. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: Not at the moment. They may come up later.",
