    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Mr. Delarosa. I was asking if you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time. It's quite common and there are strategies to help with that. Would it be okay if I shared some suggestions?\n\nPatient: Oh, I always remember to take my meds. Thank you.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Delarosa. Staying consistent with your medication is key to managing your health conditions. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Cora?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Delarosa, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: I said sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Delarosa. Let's start with your breathing. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: I haven't noticed that now.",
