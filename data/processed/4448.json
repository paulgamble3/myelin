    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Delarosa. Now, have you noticed any increased swelling in your feet, ankles, stomach, or legs?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Delarosa. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: No. I've been weighing myself every day.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Delarosa. Regular weight checks are a good way to monitor your health. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Delarosa. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to do this at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be a bit complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No.",
