    "prompt": "Nurse: apologize for\n\nPatient: having to monitor that.\n\nNurse: I understand, I understand your frustration, Mr. Delarosa. Monitoring fluid intake can be challenging. However, it's an important part of managing your CHF. Would it be okay if I shared some tips on how to manage your fluid intake?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Delarosa. One strategy could be to use a measuring cup to pour your drinks. This way, you can keep track of how much fluid you're consuming. Also, try to spread your fluid intake throughout the day. This can help you feel less thirsty. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: Okay. I guess. How much fluid should I be drinking?\n\nNurse: I'm glad Your doctor has recommended a fluid restriction of 1 liter per day, Mr. Delarosa. This includes all fluids, not just water. It's critical to try to stay within this limit. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: So one liter, like, one liter soda bottles.",
    "responses": {
        "gpt4": "Yes, one liter is equivalent to the size of a typical soda bottle. However, remember that your total daily fluid includes all beverages, as well as soups and foods like watermelon that have a high water content. Does this help clarify things for you?",
        "our_model": "Yes, Mr. Delarosa, a 1-liter soda bottle is a good way to visualize the amount of fluid you should limit yourself to in a day. It includes all fluids, not just water. Does that help clarify things?"
