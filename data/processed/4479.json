    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad Your doctor has recommended a fluid restriction of 1 liter per day, Mr. Delarosa. This includes all fluids, not just water. It's critical to try to stay within this limit. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: So one liter, like, one liter soda bottles.\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Delarosa, a 1-liter soda bottle is a good way to visualize the amount of fluid you should limit yourself to in a day. It includes all fluids, not just water. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Yes. So things like coffee and juice\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Delarosa, all fluids count towards your daily limit, including coffee, juice, and any other beverages. It's essential to keep track of these. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: and soda. Right?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Delarosa, that's correct. All fluids count towards your daily limit, including coffee, juice, and soda.
