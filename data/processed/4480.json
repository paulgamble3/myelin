    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Mr. Delarosa, a 1-liter soda bottle is a good way to visualize the amount of fluid you should limit yourself to in a day. It includes all fluids, not just water. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Yes. So things like coffee and juice\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Delarosa, all fluids count towards your daily limit, including coffee, juice, and any other beverages. It's essential to keep track of these. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: and soda. Right?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Delarosa, that's correct. All fluids count towards your daily limit, including coffee, juice, and soda. It's critical to keep track of these. Do you have any other questions about your fluid intake?\n\nPatient: No. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Delarosa. Now, let's talk about your diet. Your doctor has recommended a 2000 mg Sodium Restricted diet. This means limiting foods high in sodium. Would it be okay if I shared some tips on how to follow this diet?\n\nPatient: Okay.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. Delarosa. Here are some tips for your 2000 mg Sodium Restricted diet:\n\n1. Avoid adding salt to your food at the table and while cooking. Instead, try using herbs and spices for flavor. \n2. Limit processed and pre-packaged foods, as they tend to be high in sodium. \n3. Opt for fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. \n4. When buying canned products, look for those labeled as 'low sodium' or 'no salt added'. \n5. Always check the Nutrition Facts label for the sodium content. \n\nI hope these tips help. Do you have any questions about your diet?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Delarosa. One strategy could be to cook at home as much as possible. This way, you can control the amount of salt in your food. Also, try to avoid processed foods, as they often contain high amounts of sodium. How does that sound?"
