There are other ways to add flavor, though. For example, you could use herbs and spices, lemon juice, or vinegar. Would it be okay if I shared some more suggestions on how to make food taste good without salt?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Delarosa. One way to add flavor is to use herbs and spices.

How does that sound?\n\nPatient: Try that.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear you're willing to try, Mr. Delarosa. Remember, it's a process and it's okay to take small steps. Now, let's talk about exercise.
