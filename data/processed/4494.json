        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Delarosa. A good start could be to increase your walking from every other day to daily. Of course, pay close attention to how your body feels during and after exercising. Always stop if you feel overly tired, lightheaded, or have chest pain. Additionally, consider incorporating some light resistance training, like using elastic bands, into your routine. Start with light stretches and gradually increase as you feel comfortable. Does this sound doable to you?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Delarosa. One suggestion could be to gradually increase the frequency of your walks. For example, you could aim to walk every night instead of every other night. Another suggestion could be to add a few minutes to your walk each week. How does that sound?"
