It's important to remember that regular physical activity can help manage your conditions. However, it's crucial to do so in a way that's safe and appropriate for your health. Would it be okay if I shared some suggestions on how to safely increase your physical activity?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Delarosa. One suggestion could be to gradually increase the frequency of your walks. For example, you could aim to walk every night instead of every other night. Another suggestion could be to add a few minutes to your walk each week. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: Oh, I I can definitely do that.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Delarosa.
