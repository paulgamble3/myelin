Another suggestion could be to add a few minutes to your walk each week. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: Oh, I I can definitely do that.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Delarosa. Increasing your physical activity gradually is a good way to improve your health. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we discussed?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Delarosa. I understand that adjusting diet and exercise can be hard.

I'll be sure to inform Doctor Gervais about our conversation and how you're doing. Before we end the call, do you have any remaining questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: I don't.",
