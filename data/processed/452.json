    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear that your doctor has already discussed this with you. It's indeed very important for your safety during the procedure. Now, I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. Question.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, I'd like to ask if you have any signs of illness. Do you currently have a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Feeling good plan.\n\nNurse: Great, I'm glad to hear that. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: You bet.",

        "gpt4": "That's excellent, it's important to have that support after you leave the hospital. If you haven't arranged one yet, please still have time to figure it out. It is necessary to have someone available to pick you up when the hospital calls and to stay with you afterwards. Is everything clear so far?",
        "our_model": "That's wonderful to hear. It's important to have someone to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to arrange, remember you still have time. Do you have any questions about this?"
