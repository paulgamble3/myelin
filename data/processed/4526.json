    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Jon, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please confirm if you're feeling dizzy at the moment?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not feeling busy.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you're not feeling dizzy. It's critical to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Would you be open to some suggestions on how to manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Okay. One strategy to help manage your blood sugar levels is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, and incorporating a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: Sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad you think so. Another strategy is to stay active. Regular physical activity can help your body use insulin more effectively and lower your blood sugar levels. This could be as simple as taking a walk after meals. Do you think you could incorporate this into your routine?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
