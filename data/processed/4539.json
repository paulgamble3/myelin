        "gpt4": "That's good to hear. It's very important to take your Lisinopril as directed, two 10 mg tablets a day, which gives you the correct daily dosage of 20 mg. It's also important to take it around the same time each day, to help your body maintain a consistent level of the medication. This medication is used to treat your high blood pressure, which in turn helps to protect your kidneys. Please continue to take this medication as prescribed, unless instructed otherwise by your physician. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?",
