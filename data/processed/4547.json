    "prompt": "Patient: Some steamed vegetables,\n\nNurse: That sounds like a balanced meal. Steamed vegetables are a great choice as they retain more nutrients. How are you preparing your chicken and rice?\n\nPatient: Raspberries for Brex\n\nPatient: this.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Jon, I didn't quite catch the last part of your response. Could you please repeat what you said for breakfast?\n\nPatient: That's everything for today.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you're making an effort to eat balanced meals. I noticed you mentioned having raspberries for breakfast. That's a great choice as they're packed with vitamins. Can I provide some suggestions to further optimize your diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
