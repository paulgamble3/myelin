        "gpt4": "Great. One strategy is portion control. Try to balance your plate by filling half of it with non-starchy vegetables, a quarter with protein, and a quarter with starchy foods or grains. Another tip is to choose whole grains instead of refined grains, as they have a lower glycemic index and won't raise your blood sugar levels as much. What do you think about these suggestions?",
