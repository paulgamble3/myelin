    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Peck, I didn't quite understand. Are you saying that you're experiencing a change in your speech?\n\nPatient: No. We were talking about what play I was going to see. Never mind. We can move on.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. Of course, Mr. Peck. I apologize for any confusion earlier. You were saying you're going to see the play Camelot. That's wonderful! Are you a fan of theater and have you seen this play before?\n\nPatient: I am a fan of the theater, and no I haven't.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Peck! It's always exciting to experience a new play. Do you usually go to the theater alone or do you have someone to accompany you?\n\nPatient: I go with the group.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Peck, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: I said I go with a group.",
