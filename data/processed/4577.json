Are you a fan of theater and have you seen this play before?\n\nPatient: I am a fan of the theater, and no I haven't.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Peck! It's always exciting to experience a new play. Do you usually go to the theater alone or do you have someone to accompany you?\n\nPatient: I go with the group.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Peck, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: I said I go with a group.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a great way to enjoy the theater, Mr. Peck. Is it a social group or a group of friends who share the same interest in theater?\n\nPatient: Yes. It's my senior group.",
