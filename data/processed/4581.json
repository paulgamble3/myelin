You can definitely help slow the progression of kidney disease and potentially delay the need for dialysis by following a few steps: maintain a healthy diet low in sodium and protein, control your blood pressure, take prescribed medications as instructed, exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and limit alcohol. Regular check-ups with your healthcare provider are also essential. They can monitor your kidney function and adjust your treatment plan as necessary.
