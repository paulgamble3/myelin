Incorporating some physical activities regularly, even light ones like walking or gardening, can help lower blood pressure. The DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, could also be beneficial. It includes eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products, while reducing your intake of foods high in saturated fat and cholesterol. Have you ever heard of this diet before, Mr. Peck?",
