It's great that you're monitoring your blood pressure. A reading of 90 over 100 is within the acceptable range, but it's important to keep an eye on it. Can I share some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Peck. One way to manage your blood pressure is by reducing your salt intake. This can be achieved by avoiding processed foods and not adding extra salt to your meals. Also, regular physical activity can help lower your blood pressure. Do you currently have any physical activities incorporated into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: I really don't.",
