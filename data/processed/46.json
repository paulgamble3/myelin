Is there anything in particular you've been looking forward to doing now that you're home?\n\nPatient: I just wanna get on with my life.\n\nNurse: I can certainly appreciate that, Ms. Ware. Getting back to your normal routine can be a great step forward. On a lighter note, do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy?\n\nPatient: No. Can we get on with this call?\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Ware. I'm here to help you with any questions or concerns you might have about your health. Before we go through a few topics, do you have anything specific you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Ware. Let's start with your medications. Are you still taking your Lasix and Lisinopril as prescribed by Doctor Forbes?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
