    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Peck, could you please repeat the second number of your blood pressure reading?\n\nPatient: one hundred.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Peck. It's great that you're monitoring your blood pressure. A reading of 90 over 100 is within the acceptable range, but it's important to keep an eye on it. Can I share some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Peck. One way to manage your blood pressure is by reducing your salt intake. This can be achieved by avoiding processed foods and not adding extra salt to your meals. Also, regular physical activity can help lower your blood pressure. Do you currently have any physical activities incorporated into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: I really don't.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Peck. Incorporating some light physical activity into your day could be beneficial for managing your blood pressure. This could be as simple as taking a short walk around your neighborhood or doing some light stretching exercises at home. Would you be open to trying this?\n\nPatient: I can try walking.",

        "gpt4": "That's a great start, Mr. Peck. Walking can be a very beneficial form of exercise. How often do you feel you could commit to walking? Daily, every other day, or perhaps a few times a week? Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard.",
        "our_model": "That's great to hear, Mr. Peck! Walking is a simple yet effective way to stay active. Remember, it's important to start slow and gradually increase your activity level. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?"
