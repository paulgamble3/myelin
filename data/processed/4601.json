    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Peck. It's great that you're monitoring your blood pressure. A reading of 90 over 100 is within the acceptable range, but it's important to keep an eye on it. Can I share some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Peck. One way to manage your blood pressure is by reducing your salt intake. This can be achieved by avoiding processed foods and not adding extra salt to your meals. Also, regular physical activity can help lower your blood pressure. Do you currently have any physical activities incorporated into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: I really don't.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Peck. Incorporating some light physical activity into your day could be beneficial for managing your blood pressure. This could be as simple as taking a short walk around your neighborhood or doing some light stretching exercises at home. Would you be open to trying this?\n\nPatient: I can try walking.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Peck! Walking is a simple yet effective way to stay active. Remember, it's important to start slow and gradually increase your activity level. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: I don't know what they are.",

        "gpt4": "I see, Mr. Peck. Let me explain a few of them to you. One of them is the Sodium result. This is a test that measures the level of sodium in your blood. Sodium plays an important role in regulating blood volume and pressure, among other things. Your result is 141 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. \n\nAnother result is the Creatinine test. Creatinine is a waste product that your kidneys filter out of the body. A high creatinine level may indicate that your kidneys are not filtering waste products efficiently. Your result is 0.85 mg/dL, which is also within the normal range. \n\nThe last one I'll explain is the Urine Albumin result. This is a test that measures the amount of protein (specifically albumin) in your urine. A high level of albumin in the urine can be a sign of kidney damage. Your result is 280 mg/g, which is a bit high.\n\nDo you understand these explanations, Mr. Peck, or do you have any questions about them?",
        "our_model": "I see, Mr. Peck. Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 141 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 3.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, which measures the amount of waste product in your blood, is 7.10 mmol/L. Your creatinine, a waste product produced by your muscles, is 0.85 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, which measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste, is 88 mL/min/1.73m2. Lastly, your urine albumin, a protein that can indicate kidney damage, is 280 mg/g. Do you have any questions about these results?"
