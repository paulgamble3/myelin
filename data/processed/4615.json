The answer is yes, managing diabetes can sometimes lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression. It's important to talk to your doctor if you're feeling this way. Now, I want to remind you that there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for CKD patients to take. It's always best to talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Because we're talking about my diabetes medication. How to study Beatty's effect my mental health?\n\nNurse: That's an interesting question, Mr. Peck. While diabetes itself can sometimes cause changes in mood or mental health due to the physical changes in the body, the medications used to treat diabetes, like Lantus and Aspart, are not typically known to have a direct effect on mental health. However, it's important to monitor any changes in your mood or mental health and discuss them with your doctor. Have you noticed any changes in your mental health recently?\n\nPatient: No. I was just wondering.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Peck. It's always good to be curious and ask questions about your health.

        "gpt4": "That's a great question, Mr. Peck. In general, you should avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn). These can harm your kidneys, especially when used in large amounts. Some supplements, like creatine or certain herbal remedies, can also be harmful to kidneys. Always discuss any new supplement or over-the-counter medication with your doctor before starting it. Any other questions on this topic?",
