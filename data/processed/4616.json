The answer is yes, managing diabetes can sometimes lead to feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression. It's important to talk to your doctor if you're feeling this way. Now, I want to remind you that there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for CKD patients to take. It's always best to talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Because we're talking about my diabetes medication. How to study Beatty's effect my mental health?\n\nNurse: That's an interesting question, Mr. Peck. While diabetes itself can sometimes cause changes in mood or mental health due to the physical changes in the body, the medications used to treat diabetes, like Lantus and Aspart, are not typically known to have a direct effect on mental health. However, it's important to monitor any changes in your mood or mental health and discuss them with your doctor. Have you noticed any changes in your mental health recently?\n\nPatient: No. I was just wondering.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Peck. It's always good to be curious and ask questions about your health.

        "gpt4": "That's a great question, Mr. Peck. There are several types of over-the-counter drugs that you should generally avoid with chronic kidney disease. These include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and naproxen, some antacids that contain magnesium and phosphate, and certain laxatives and cold medicines. It's also important to avoid herbal supplements without speaking to your doctor first, as some of them can harm your kidneys. Some types of medication may need to be adjusted by your doctor to make sure they're safe for you. Do you currently take any over-the-counter medications or supplements?",
