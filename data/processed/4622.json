    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize for any confusion earlier, Mr. Peck. You mentioned earlier that you usually have cereal for breakfast, a tuna sandwich for lunch, and chicken or fish with vegetables for dinner. You also mentioned that you enjoy dessert. Can you tell me a bit more about the types of desserts you usually have?\n\nPatient: I've been using Wishbone Italian salad dressing.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Peck. It's great that you're making an effort to include salads in your meals. However, some salad dressings can be high in sodium. Would you be open to checking the sodium content on the label of your Wishbone Italian salad dressing?\n\nPatient: Is that okay? Or is this that high in salt? Or can I have it?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry for any confusion earlier, Mr. Peck. You mentioned that you've been using Wishbone Italian salad dressing. Could you tell me a bit more about how you're using it?\n\nPatient: Well, how else would I use it on my salad? Which I don't really enjoy.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Peck. Using salad dressing like Wishbone Italian can add flavor to your salads. However, many salad dressings can be high in sodium. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label on the bottle to see how much sodium it contains. Would you like me to provide some suggestions for low-sodium alternatives?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Peck. For a lower sodium option, you could consider making a simple dressing at home using olive oil and vinegar. Another option could be to use a squeeze of fresh lemon or lime juice on your salad. Would you be open to trying these alternatives?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Peck. One option could be to make your own salad dressing at home using ingredients like olive oil, vinegar, and herbs. This way, you can control the amount of sodium in your dressing. Another option could be to look for low-sodium versions of your favorite salad dressings at the store. What do you think about these suggestions?"
