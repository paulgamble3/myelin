    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry for any confusion earlier, Mr. Peck. You mentioned that you've been using Wishbone Italian salad dressing. Could you tell me a bit more about how you're using it?\n\nPatient: Well, how else would I use it on my salad? Which I don't really enjoy.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Peck. Using salad dressing like Wishbone Italian can add flavor to your salads. However, many salad dressings can be high in sodium. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label on the bottle to see how much sodium it contains. Would you like me to provide some suggestions for low-sodium alternatives?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Peck. One option could be to make your own salad dressing at home using ingredients like olive oil, vinegar, and herbs. This way, you can control the amount of sodium in your dressing. Another option could be to look for low-sodium versions of your favorite salad dressings at the store. What do you think about these suggestions?\n\nPatient: How do I know if they're low sodium?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Peck. When you're looking at the nutrition label on a food product, the amount of sodium is listed in milligrams. A food is considered low in sodium if it has 140 milligrams or less per serving. It's always a good idea to compare the sodium content of different products to find the one that's lowest. Would you like me to provide some more tips on reading nutrition labels?\n\nPatient: No. That was very helpful, though. Thank you.",
