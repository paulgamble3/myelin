It must be a relief to be in your own space again. Is there anything you're particularly looking forward to doing now that you're home?\n\nPatient: Oh, just I would really like to get some sleep, but Since the doctor increased my lASIKs, I have to get up to go pee so often. I'm having a hard time having a good night sleep.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble sleeping. It's quite common for Lasix to increase urination as it helps your body get rid of extra fluid. However, it's important to take it as prescribed to manage your CHF symptoms. Are you still taking your Valsartan as well?\n\nPatient: Attendance.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: I didn't do the same thing.",
