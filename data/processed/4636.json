If you ever change your mind about quitting, I have lots of resources that could help you. Would you like me to share these with you now, or would you prefer to wait until you're ready?\n\nPatient: I'd rather wait until I'm ready.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Peck. Whenever you feel ready to discuss it, know that I'm here to provide support and resources. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Peck.
