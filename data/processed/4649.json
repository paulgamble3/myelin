    "prompt": "Nurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Amador. There are so many places to discover and books to explore. Now, I'd like to talk about your upcoming colonoscopy. How are you feeling about the procedure?\n\nPatient: A little scared, but fine overall.\n\nNurse: It's completely normal to feel a bit scared, Mr. Amador. This is a significant procedure, and it's okay to have feelings about it. Can you tell me more about what's making you feel scared?\n\nPatient: Just feels invasive.\n\nNurse: I can see why you might feel that way, Mr. Amador. It's a procedure that requires a bit of personal space. However, it's being done by Doctor Meredith Bailey, who is an excellent gastroenterologist with over 1500 colonoscopies under her belt. She's there to ensure your safety and comfort. Is there anything else that's bothering you about the procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Amador. If you have any questions or concerns at any point, feel free to ask. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
