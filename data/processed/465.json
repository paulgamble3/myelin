However, it's important to take it as prescribed to manage your CHF symptoms. Are you still taking your Valsartan as well?\n\nPatient: Attendance.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: I didn't do the same thing.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I'm still not clear on what you're saying. Could you please repeat it or rephrase it?\n\nPatient: I'm not saying anything.\n\nNurse: I see, thank you for clarifying. Let's move on to your medications. Are you still taking your Valsartan and Lasix as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
