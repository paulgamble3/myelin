    "prompt": "Patient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Amador. If you have any questions or concerns at any point, feel free to ask. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Amador. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to blood in your stool. It can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Amador, could you please confirm what you just said?\n\nPatient: I said it's fine. Can we just get through with this conversation?\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. Give me a moment while I figure out how I can best help you.",
