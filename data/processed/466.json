Could you please repeat it or rephrase it?\n\nPatient: I'm not saying anything.\n\nNurse: I see, thank you for clarifying. Let's move on to your medications. Are you still taking your Valsartan and Lasix as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's critical to take your medications as prescribed to manage your CHF and HTN. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time?\n\nPatient: No. But like I said, sometimes, I'll stop taking the lasex just so I can get some sleep",
