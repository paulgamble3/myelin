Is there anything you'd like to discuss before we proceed?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Let's first get all the logistics out of the way, Mr. Amador. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 10:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you, Mr. Amador?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you, Mr. Amador?\n\nPatient: No.",
