Are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners, Mr. Amador?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Amador. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet prep for your colonoscopy.

This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: No.",
