    "prompt": "Nurse: I see on your chart that you're currently not on any medication that needs to be stopped before the procedure. Are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners, Mr. Amador?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Amador. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet prep for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to eat a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. What are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: I like pasta.",

        "gpt4": "Excellent choice, Mr. Amador. Pasta is a good low-fiber food that's easy to prepare. Feel free to enjoy it in the lead-up to your procedure. Now, the day before the colonoscopy, you'll need to have a clear liquid diet. This means you can have broth, gelatin, clear juice, and drinks like coffee and tea, but without the milk or cream. Do you have any questions about the clear liquid diet?",
        "our_model": "That's great, Mr. Amador. Pasta is a good choice for a low fiber diet. Do you have a favorite pasta dish that you enjoy?"
