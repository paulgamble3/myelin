    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet prep for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to eat a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. What are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: I like pasta.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Amador. Pasta is a good choice for a low fiber diet. Do you have a favorite pasta dish that you enjoy?\n\nPatient: Rigatoni.\n\nNurse: That sounds delicious, Mr. Amador. Rigatoni is a great choice. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. Just remember that you should also avoid eating red or purple foods because they can tint the colon and make seeing polyps more difficult during the colonoscopy. Do you have any food color restrictions in your diet?",
        "our_model": "I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications, Mr. Amador?"
