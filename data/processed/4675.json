    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications, Mr. Amador?\n\nPatient: So\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Amador, could you please repeat what you just said?\n\nPatient: I said no.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Amador. Do you have any questions about why it's necessary to stop these supplements before your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.",
