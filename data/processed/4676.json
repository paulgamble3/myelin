    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Amador, could you please repeat what you just said?\n\nPatient: I said no.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Amador. Do you have any questions about why it's necessary to stop these supplements before your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Amador. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. On the day before your procedure, you'll have a clear liquid diet. This includes things like apple juice, clear broth or bouillon, water, plain coffee (without cream) and gelatin desserts (without fruit or toppings). How do you feel about these options?",
        "our_model": "That's good to hear, Mr. Amador. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?"
