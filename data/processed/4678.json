    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Amador. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Amador. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Amador. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: I don't have any. Thanks. I'm good.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Amador. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: Though.",

        "gpt4": "You will also need to start taking the laxative preparation called GoLYTELY. It's recommended that you start drinking it at 5:00 PM the night before the procedure. You need to drink a glass every 10 minutes until the solution is gone. Are you comfortable with these instructions, or do you have any concerns?",
