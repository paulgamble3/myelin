    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand, Mr. Amador. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Amador. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: I don't have any. Thanks. I'm good.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Amador. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: Though.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Amador, could you please repeat what you just said?\n\nPatient: I said no.",

        "gpt4": "That's good to hear, Mr. Amador. Now, I'll explain briefly about the GoLYTELY laxative solution that you'll be taking. You'll start drinking it the day before your procedure, after your day of drinking only clear liquids. The GoLYTELY serves to clean out your colon, which is crucial for a successful colonoscopy. It can cause frequent bowel movements and some mild discomfort, but it's a necessary part of the preparation. How do you feel about this?",
        "our_model": "That's good to hear, Mr. Amador. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?"
