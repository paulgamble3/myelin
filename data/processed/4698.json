        "gpt4": "I understand your concern. CHF is a chronic condition, and it can change over time due to multiple factors including age, lifestyle, and how your body responds to medication. However, with the right treatment plan underlying causes can be addressed, symptoms managed, and progression slowed. Have you picked up your new medication, Captopril oral tablets from the pharmacy yet?",
