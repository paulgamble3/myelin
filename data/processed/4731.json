Give me a moment to check how I can best support you. That's good to hear. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep track of these symptoms at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be a bit complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: I don't think I remember the questions you asked, and I did clarify by saying\n\nNurse: I\n\nPatient: but I don't think I gained weight.\n\nNurse: apologize for I apologize for any confusion. To clarify, the questions were about any new or worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, dry cough, swelling in your feet, ankles, stomach, or legs, weight gain, and whether you've been using more pillows to sleep. These are all important symptoms to monitor for CHF.
