    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful. Instead of having soup, which can be high in sodium, you might consider having a salad with a homemade dressing. This way, you can control the amount of salt. Instead of sweets, you might consider having a piece of fruit when you're craving something sweet. This can help manage your blood sugar levels. And remember, it's okay to have a treat occasionally. It's all about balance. How does that sound to you?\n\nPatient: It sounds like it's making a little bit more sense to me.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. It's all about making small changes that can make a big difference in managing your CHF and diabetes. Now, let's talk about exercise. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: I'm trying to get out there and walk. I'm trying to walk.\n\nNurse: That's fantastic. Walking is a great form of exercise, especially for managing CHF and diabetes. How often are you able to go for walks?\n\nPatient: At least a half hour a day. I'm doing pretty well. With that.\n\nNurse: That's fantastic to hear! Walking is a great form of exercise, especially for managing CHF and diabetes. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Fantastic! Now, walking is a great low-impact exercise to start with. You could consider starting with shorter walks and then gradually extend it as you feel more comfortable. Another idea is to make it a habit to take a few minutes to stretch before and after your walks. This builds flexibility and helps prevent injury. And, if you feel up for it, you could add some light strength-training exercises, like resistance bands or light weights, for a well-rounded routine. Remember, it's crucial to go at your own pace and listen to your body's signals. How does that sound to you?",
        "our_model": "Excellent. It's critical to listen to your body while exercising. If you feel short of breath or fatigued, it's okay to slow down or take a break. Also, consider incorporating some light strength training exercises, like lifting small hand weights or using resistance bands. This can help improve your overall strength and endurance. Remember, it's always best to consult with your doctor before starting any new exercise routine. How does that sound to you?"
