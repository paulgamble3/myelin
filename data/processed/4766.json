Is there anything in particular you've been looking forward to doing now that you're home?\n\nPatient: Just spending time with my kids.\n\nNurse: That sounds wonderful, Mr. Shyam. Family time is precious. How many children do you have?\n\nPatient: I have two.\n\nNurse: That's lovely, Mr. Shyam. It must be nice to have them around. What activities do you enjoy doing with your kids?\n\nPatient: We enjoy riding our bikes together.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a great way to spend time together, Mr. Shyam. Biking is also a good form of exercise. Do you have a favorite trail or park where you like to ride with your kids?\n\nPatient: Not really. We just go wherever.",
