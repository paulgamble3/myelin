    "prompt": "Nurse: That's lovely, Mr. Shyam. It must be nice to have them around. What activities do you enjoy doing with your kids?\n\nPatient: We enjoy riding our bikes together.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a great way to spend time together, Mr. Shyam. Biking is also a good form of exercise. Do you have a favorite trail or park where you like to ride with your kids?\n\nPatient: Not really. We just go wherever.\n\nNurse: That's a fun and flexible approach, Mr. Shyam. It's great that you're keeping active with your kids. Now, before we move on to some health-related topics, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I do have a question.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Shyam. What's your question?\n\nPatient: How is CHF diagnosed?",

        "gpt4": "CHF, or Chronic Heart Failure, is diagnosed through a combination of physical examination, medical history, and diagnostic tests. During a physical exam, a doctor may listen to your heart to check for abnormal heart rhythms, and to your lungs to hear if there's fluid buildup.\n\nIn terms of diagnostic tests, these can include blood tests, chest X-rays, echocardiograms (which are ultrasounds of the heart), electrocardiograms (measuring the electrical activity of your heart), stress tests, MRIs, and sometimes more advanced procedures like coronary angiograms. \n\nThese tests help the doctor assess the structure and function of your heart, and guide treatment. However, every patient\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds journey is different. Does that help answer your question, Mr. Shyam?",
        "our_model": "CHF, or Congestive Heart Failure, is typically diagnosed through a combination of medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. These tests may include an electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests, chest x-ray, and echocardiogram. The doctor looks for signs of fluid buildup, heart enlargement, or other issues that indicate the heart isn't pumping as effectively as it should be. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this, Mr. Shyam?"
