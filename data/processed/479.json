    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: Well, they waived me at the ER. And\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: I was a hundred and eighty eight pounds. But I haven't weighed myself since then because my bathroom scales broke.\n\nNurse: I see, it's important to monitor your weight regularly as sudden weight gain can be a sign of fluid retention. When you get a chance, could you please get your weight checked at a pharmacy or a friend's house?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I can try to do that.\n\nNurse: That would be very helpful. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: Okay.",
