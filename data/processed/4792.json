    "prompt": "Nurse: It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious before a procedure, especially when it's a major one like a total knee replacement. However, rest assured that you're in the hands of a highly skilled surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, who has performed over 1000 total knee replacements. As for the difficulty in walking after the surgery, it's a temporary phase. Physical therapy and rehabilitation will help you regain your strength and mobility. Before we move on, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I can't think of any.\n\nNurse: Alright. If any questions come up during our conversation, feel free to ask at any time. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: I will be there.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am. I will be there.",
