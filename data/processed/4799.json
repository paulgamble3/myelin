    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. Do you have any questions about Plavix or why it was necessary to stop it before your procedure?\n\nPatient: No. I understand.\n\nNurse: Alright. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: It already.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: I usually take Advil\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's essential to note that medications like Advil, which are blood thinners, typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Have you been instructed to continue taking Advil?\n\nPatient: but I stopped taking that already.",
