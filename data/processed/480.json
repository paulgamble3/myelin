But I haven't weighed myself since then because my bathroom scales broke.\n\nNurse: I see, it's important to monitor your weight regularly as sudden weight gain can be a sign of fluid retention. When you get a chance, could you please get your weight checked at a pharmacy or a friend's house?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I can try to do that.\n\nNurse: That would be very helpful. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.",
