    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to stop taking Advil as it's a blood thinner. Do you have any questions about why it's necessary to stop these medications before your knee replacement?\n\nPatient: No. I understand.\n\nNurse: Great. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol and Tramadol for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. Advil, also known as ibuprofen, is not a blood thinner. It's a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can increase the risk of bleeding. That's why it's important to stop taking it before surgery. Do you have any questions about this or any other medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.",

        "gpt4": "Great, you're well-prepared. Let's go over the instructions for using the chlorhexidine scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Does that sound good so far?",
        "our_model": "That's great to hear. The chlorhexidine scrub is an important step in preparing for your surgery. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions one by one. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?"
