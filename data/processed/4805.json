    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. Advil, also known as ibuprofen, is not a blood thinner. It's a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can increase the risk of bleeding. That's why it's important to stop taking it before surgery. Do you have any questions about this or any other medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. The chlorhexidine scrub is an important step in preparing for your surgery. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions one by one. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
