Let's go over the instructions one by one. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Finally, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that was a lot. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No. I understand. I\n\nNurse: Alright. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: actually read the directions to make sure I knew what to do.",
