        "gpt4": "Yes, while arthritis primarily affects joints, it can influence other parts of the body as well. For instance, some forms of arthritis can affect the skin, eyes, lungs, kidneys, and even the heart. Rheumatoid arthritis, in particular, is a systemic disease, meaning it can impact the entire body. While your osteoarthritis primarily affects your knee joint, it\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds always important to discuss any new or worsening symptoms with your healthcare provider. Does that answer your question?",
        "our_model": "Yes, arthritis can indeed affect other parts of the body besides joints. There are many different types of arthritis, and some can affect other parts of the body in addition to the joints. For example, rheumatoid arthritis can affect the skin, eyes, lungs, heart, and blood vessels. Psoriatic arthritis is associated with psoriasis, a skin condition. Lupus, an autoimmune disease, can also affect various parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart, and lungs. It's critical to discuss any concerns or symptoms with your doctor, who can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Do you have any other questions or concerns?"
