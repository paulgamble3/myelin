Standard procedure.\n\nNurse: I see, thank you for sharing, Mr. Kageyama. It's indeed a standard procedure, but we understand that it can still raise some concerns. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we begin?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Kageyama, I'm here. You mentioned earlier that you're feeling fine about the procedure. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have at this point?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. Please remember that you can ask me any questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy as a preventative screening for colon cancer. It can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Really? Okay.",
