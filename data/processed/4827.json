    "prompt": "Nurse: I see, thank you for sharing, Mr. Kageyama. It's indeed a standard procedure, but we understand that it can still raise some concerns. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we begin?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Kageyama, I'm here. You mentioned earlier that you're feeling fine about the procedure. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have at this point?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. Please remember that you can ask me any questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy as a preventative screening for colon cancer. It can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Really? Okay.\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Kageyama, it's a preventative screening to take care of your health. It's great that you're taking this step. Do you have any concerns or questions about the procedure?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad to hear you have no further concerns. You should start your bowel prep the day before your colonoscopy. You will need to avoid eating solid food and drink clear liquids only. It's also important to begin taking the laxative prescribed by your doctor. This ensures your colon is clear for the procedure. \n\nRemember, if you experience severe abdominal pain, fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, you should go to the emergency room immediately.\n\nThank you for your time. We look forward to seeing you on the date of your procedure. Take care, Mr. Kageyama.",
