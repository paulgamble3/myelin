Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Kageyama. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. There are no changes to this medication before your colonoscopy.
