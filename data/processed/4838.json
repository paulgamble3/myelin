    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's critical to avoid those medications before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications in relation to your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. It's critical to follow this diet to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Hello, pasta.\n\nNurse: Pasta is a great choice, Mr. Kageyama. It's easy to digest and can be quite comforting. Do you have a favorite pasta dish you're thinking of having during this time?\n\nPatient: I like to send Cheesy Alfredo.",

        "gpt4": "Cheesy Alfredo pasta sounds delightful, Mr. Kageyama. Including some of your favorite foods can make following the pre-colonoscopy diet a bit easier. This might be one of the few occasions when doctors advise eating such comfort foods as pasta with a cheesy Alfredo sauce. Do you typically prepare this dish yourself or do you have a favorite restaurant that makes it?",
        "our_model": "Cheesy Alfredo sounds delicious, Mr. Kageyama. It's a good choice for a low fiber diet. Just remember to avoid adding high fiber ingredients like whole grain pasta or lots of vegetables. This is one of those rare times when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're considering?"
