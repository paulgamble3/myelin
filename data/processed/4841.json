    "prompt": "Nurse: Pasta is a great choice, Mr. Kageyama. It's easy to digest and can be quite comforting. Do you have a favorite pasta dish you're thinking of having during this time?\n\nPatient: I like to send Cheesy Alfredo.\n\nNurse: Cheesy Alfredo sounds delicious, Mr. Kageyama. It's a good choice for a low fiber diet. Just remember to avoid adding high fiber ingredients like whole grain pasta or lots of vegetables. This is one of those rare times when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're considering?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's critical to avoid those supplements and medications before a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or any other supplements or medications you're considering?\n\nPatient: No.",
