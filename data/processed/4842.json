    "prompt": "Nurse: Cheesy Alfredo sounds delicious, Mr. Kageyama. It's a good choice for a low fiber diet. Just remember to avoid adding high fiber ingredients like whole grain pasta or lots of vegetables. This is one of those rare times when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're considering?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's critical to avoid those supplements and medications before a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or any other supplements or medications you're considering?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.",

We're here to support you though. Are there any questions or concerns you have regarding this part of the preparation?",
