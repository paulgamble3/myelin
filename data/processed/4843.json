    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's critical to avoid those supplements and medications before a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or any other supplements or medications you're considering?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Kageyama. It's true that most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about the clear liquid diet or the GoLYTELY laxative solution?\n\nPatient: Nope.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Kageyama. I want to emphasize that you don't have to do anything just yet. But, when the time comes, you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light-colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Do you have any questions so far about clear liquids?",

Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?"
