    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Kageyama. It's critical to avoid those supplements and medications before a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or any other supplements or medications you're considering?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Kageyama. It's true that most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about the clear liquid diet or the GoLYTELY laxative solution?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: No. That's okay.",

        "gpt4": "Okay, Mr. Kageyama. If you think of any questions about the clear liquid diet, don't hesitate to ask. You'll need to follow this diet the day before your procedure. We're here to support you if there's anything you're unsure of. Now, let's talk about the GoLYTELY laxative solution you'll need to take. You'll need to start drinking the first half of this solution around 6PM the night before your procedure. The other half you'll finish drinking early the morning of the procedure. Would you like to hear some tips on making the bowel prep easier?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?"
