    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Kageyama. It's true that most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about the clear liquid diet or the GoLYTELY laxative solution?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: No. That's okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Kageyama. If you have any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. Thanks.",
