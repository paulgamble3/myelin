We went over your colonoscopy scheduled on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Dr. Meredith Bailey. You're clear on all the diet instructions, including your current Tylenol medication and avoiding other blood thinners and supplements. You're also aware of the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution to be taken the day before your procedure. Lastly, we checked your current health status and confirmed you have arranged a ride home post-procedure. Does that sound right?",
