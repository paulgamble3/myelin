    "prompt": "Nurse: That's perfectly fine. Remember, you can ask me any questions at any time during our conversation. I'm here to help you feel as comfortable and prepared as possible for your procedure. On a lighter note, you must be looking forward to getting a new knee. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once you've recovered from your surgery?\n\nPatient: Well, I would like to just be able to go for a walk around the block without being in horrible pain.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Walking is a great way to stay active and it will be beneficial for your recovery as well. Do you have a favorite route or area you're looking forward to walking in?\n\nPatient: No. I just walk around my block.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. Walking around your block can be a great way to enjoy some fresh air and it's a good start to getting back to your normal routine. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. I was planning on that.",
