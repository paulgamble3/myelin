    "prompt": "Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Walking is a great way to stay active and it will be beneficial for your recovery as well. Do you have a favorite route or area you're looking forward to walking in?\n\nPatient: No. I just walk around my block.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. Walking around your block can be a great way to enjoy some fresh air and it's a good start to getting back to your normal routine. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. I was planning on that.\n\nNurse: Perfect, it's good to hear that you're well-prepared. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's fine.",
