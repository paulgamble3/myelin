    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance 25 mg two times a day, Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg two times a day, Atorvastatin 20 mg once a day, and Ozempic 2 mg once a week. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we haven't discussed, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: I take Tylenol.\n\nNurse: I see. Tylenol is usually safe to continue taking, but it's always best to confirm with your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Celebrex 100 mg two times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, you're well-prepared. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medications you're currently taking?\n\nPatient: Well,",
