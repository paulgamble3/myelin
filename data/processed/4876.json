    "prompt": "Nurse: I see. Tylenol is usually safe to continue taking, but it's always best to confirm with your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Celebrex 100 mg two times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great, you're well-prepared. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medications you're currently taking?\n\nPatient: Well,\n\nNurse: Yes?\n\nPatient: I stopped my aspirin Because I thought I needed to stop taking that prior to the procedure. Is that correct?\n\nNurse: Yes, that's correct. It's generally recommended to stop taking Aspirin about 7 days before the procedure. It's good to hear that you've already stopped. Is there anything else you're unsure about regarding your medications?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.",
