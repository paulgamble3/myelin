    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great, you're well-prepared. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medications you're currently taking?\n\nPatient: Well,\n\nNurse: Yes?\n\nPatient: I stopped my aspirin Because I thought I needed to stop taking that prior to the procedure. Is that correct?\n\nNurse: Yes, that's correct. It's generally recommended to stop taking Aspirin about 7 days before the procedure. It's good to hear that you've already stopped. Is there anything else you're unsure about regarding your medications?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased a chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
