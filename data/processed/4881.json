    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great, you're ahead of the game. The chlorhexidine scrub is used to clean your skin and reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions one by one. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect. After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's essential to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great. Finally, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No. You've explained it very well.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: The night before in the morning up.",

        "gpt4": "That's correct, the night before and the morning of the procedure. Good job! The next part of your preparation is about when to stop eating and drinking before your knee replacement. It's important for your safety during the procedure that you do not eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can you do that?",
        "our_model": "Yes, that's correct. The last thing we need to discuss is when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?"
