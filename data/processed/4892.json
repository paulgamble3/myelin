    "prompt": "Nurse: Metamucil Crackers and Fiber Thins are both food products that are high in fiber. They can be a good addition to your diet as they can help with digestion and weight management. However, it's important to remember that they are just one part of a balanced diet. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional or a dietitian for personalized advice. Now, let's move on to the next question. Have you noticed any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches recently?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I see that your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure. Is that still correct?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's correct.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. It's important to have a plan in place for when you return home. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any questions you have, feel free to ask.\n\nPatient: I just wanna know how soon after surgery will I start feeling better.",

        "gpt4": "That's a good question. Pain relief after total knee replacement varies from person to person. Some patients report immediate relief from their arthritis pain after surgery, while others may take a week or two to start feeling better. Much of the overall recovery and getting back to day-to-day activities can be achieved in three to six months. However, it is important to remember that outcomes can vary and a successful recovery requires active participation in your physical therapy plan. Would you like to know more about what to expect during recovery?",
        "our_model": "Recovery times can vary from person to person, but generally, you can expect to start feeling better within a few weeks after surgery. Most people are able to walk with the aid of a walker or cane within a day or two after surgery. However, it may take 3 to 6 weeks or longer to fully recover and regain strength and mobility. It's critical to follow your doctor's instructions and participate in physical therapy to aid your recovery. Does that help?"
