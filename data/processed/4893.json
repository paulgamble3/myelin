    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I see that your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure. Is that still correct?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's correct.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. It's important to have a plan in place for when you return home. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any questions you have, feel free to ask.\n\nPatient: I just wanna know how soon after surgery will I start feeling better.\n\nNurse: Recovery times can vary from person to person, but generally, you can expect to start feeling better within a few weeks after surgery. Most people are able to walk with the aid of a walker or cane within a day or two after surgery. However, it may take 3 to 6 weeks or longer to fully recover and regain strength and mobility. It's critical to follow your doctor's instructions and participate in physical therapy to aid your recovery. Does that help?\n\nPatient: Yes. I'm gonna do all those things.",
