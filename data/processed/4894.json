    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful. It's important to have a plan in place for when you return home. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any questions you have, feel free to ask.\n\nPatient: I just wanna know how soon after surgery will I start feeling better.\n\nNurse: Recovery times can vary from person to person, but generally, you can expect to start feeling better within a few weeks after surgery. Most people are able to walk with the aid of a walker or cane within a day or two after surgery. However, it may take 3 to 6 weeks or longer to fully recover and regain strength and mobility. It's critical to follow your doctor's instructions and participate in physical therapy to aid your recovery. Does that help?\n\nPatient: Yes. I'm gonna do all those things.\n\nNurse: That's the spirit. Your commitment to following the recovery plan will be key to your success. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: Really, I can't think of any.",

        "gpt4": "That's okay. If you come up with any questions later, don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help you. Now, just to summarize, you will need to have a chlorhexidine scrub the night before and morning of the procedure, remember to stop eating and drinking after midnight, take your medications as prescribed, and arrange for a ride home after the procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?",
        "our_model": "Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to reach out. Before we end the call, let's summarize what you still need to do before your procedure. You need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?"
