Could you please repeat what you said about your diet?\n\nPatient: I didn't say anything.\n\nNurse: My apologies for the confusion. You mentioned you're on a low salt, low carb diet. That's a great start. As for other dietary changes, it's important to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. However, it's always best to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized advice. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics to check on how you're doing?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you.

Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: One thirty two.",
