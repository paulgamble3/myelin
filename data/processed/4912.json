    "prompt": "Nurse: My apologies for the confusion. You mentioned you're on a low salt, low carb diet. That's a great start. As for other dietary changes, it's important to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. However, it's always best to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized advice. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics to check on how you're doing?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Six. Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: One thirty two.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. A blood sugar level of 132 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great! Regular physical activity can help your body use insulin more effectively. Be sure to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise, like brisk walking, most days of the week if possible. Another strategy is to balance your intake of carbs, proteins, and fats throughout the day. This can help prevent blood sugar spikes and crashes. Lastly, maintain a regular eating schedule. Skipping meals can affect your blood sugar levels. Please take these suggestions one by one and make sure you understand each before moving on. Have you been able to keep up with your physical activity?",
