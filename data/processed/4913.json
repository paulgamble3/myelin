    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, thank you. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Six. Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: One thirty two.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. A blood sugar level of 132 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent. One strategy is to ensure you're eating balanced meals. This includes a mix of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. It's also important to limit your intake of sugary drinks and high-sugar foods. Regular physical activity can also help lower your blood sugar levels. Do you think these are strategies you could incorporate into your daily routine?\n\nPatient: Yes. I think so.",
