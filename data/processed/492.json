    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's a good start. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations to align your diet with the CHF guidelines. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: I guess.\n\nNurse: Thank you. One recommendation would be to limit your fluid intake to 1 liter per day. This includes all fluids, not just water. Another recommendation is to follow a diet that restricts your sodium intake to 1500 mg per day. This can help manage your CHF symptoms. Would you like me to note these recommendations down for the dietitian to discuss with you?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: I've noted down your request for the dietitian to discuss these recommendations with you. Now, let's talk about exercise. Could you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: I don't really have one. Does getting up off the couch and walking to the kitchen count,\n\nNurse: Yes, every bit of movement counts. It's critical to gradually increase your activity level as much as you can. Would it be okay if I share some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner?\n\nPatient: Oh, sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great! One thing you could start with is taking short, gradual walks around your home. This is a good way to increase your activity level progressively. Start with what you feel comfortable with, even if it's just a few minutes at a time. Try to increase the time every few days as you feel able. Remember to stop if you feel tired, dizzy, or short of breath. Would you be comfortable starting with this?",
        "our_model": "Thank you. One recommendation could be to start with light activities, such as walking around your home or doing some gentle stretching exercises. As you feel comfortable, you can gradually increase the duration and intensity of your activities. It's critical to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Would you like me to note these recommendations down for Doctor Van?"
