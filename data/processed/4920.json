    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay. Some strategies to manage blood pressure include reducing your salt intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and incorporating regular physical activity into your routine. It's also important to limit alcohol and quit smoking if you do. Do you think these are strategies you could implement?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I can implement those, but I do smoke.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your honesty.\n\nPatient: And I really don't wanna give that up right now.\n\nNurse: I understand that quitting smoking can be a challenging process. It's essential to remember that it's a step-by-step journey and it's okay to take it one day at a time. When you're ready, there are resources available to help you. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What does Bunn mean,\n\nNurse: BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen. It's a test that measures the amount of nitrogen in your blood that comes from the waste product urea. Urea is made in your liver when protein is broken down. Your BUN level can help your doctor check how well your kidneys are working. Your BUN level was 6.87 mmol/L, which is within the normal range. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. And what about my create need?",

        "gpt4": "Creatinine is a waste product that comes from the normal wear and tear on muscles of the body. The kidneys filter out most of your creatinine and dispose of it in urine. It's normal for everyone to have a small amount of creatinine in their blood, but a higher than normal value could indicate that your kidneys are not working as well as they should. Your recent test shows a creatinine level of 0.8 mg/dL, which falls within the normal range. Does that clear things up for you?",
        "our_model": "Creatinine is a waste product that's produced by your muscles. It's normally removed from your blood by your kidneys. When your kidneys aren't working properly, the level of creatinine in your blood can increase. Your creatinine level was 0.8 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. This suggests that your kidneys are functioning well at this time. Does that make sense?"
