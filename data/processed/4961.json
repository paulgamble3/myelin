If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some suggestions that might help you remember to take your medications on time. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: no. For the most part, I'm good about taking my medicines.\n\nNurse: It's quite common to miss a dose here or there, Mr. Hooper. You're doing a great job managing your medications.
