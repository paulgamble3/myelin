If it's okay with you, I'd like to ask a few questions about your symptoms to understand how you're doing at home. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Please get on with it.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Hooper. Let's start with your breathing. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Hooper. Now, have you experienced any ongoing or worsening chest pain recently?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Hooper. How about a new or worsening dry cough?\n\nPatient: No dry cough whatsoever. Hooper.",
