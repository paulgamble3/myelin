Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: Carry on.\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion earlier, Mr. Hooper. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: No weight gain whatsoever.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Hooper. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. Hooper. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep track of these symptoms at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: If I can remember what you asked",

        "gpt4": "That's understandable, Mr. Hooper. Keeping track of symptoms can get confusing sometimes. Just a brief recap - look out for changes in your breathing, any new onset of cough, chest pain, swelling in your lower extremities, unexpected weight gain, and any increase in the use of pillows for sleeping. Additionally, ensure that you're taking your medications as prescribed. If you notice any changes, reach out to your healthcare provider. Do you have any other questions for me?",
