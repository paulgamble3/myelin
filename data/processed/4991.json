Could you please repeat what you said about the types of foods you typically eat?\n\nPatient: And there are many days that you have to fast.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Hooper. It sounds like your diet is quite restrictive due to your Jain vegetarian beliefs. Can you tell me more about the fasting practices?\n\nPatient: Do you know what is safe to eat?\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion earlier, Mr. Hooper. It sounds like you're following a Jain vegetarian diet, which includes fasting and avoiding foods that come from animals. Can you tell me more about the types of fruits and vegetables you usually have?\n\nPatient: That will be both cardiac And Jane Vegetarian? In nature,\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion earlier, Mr. Hooper. It sounds like you're looking for foods that are both cardiac and Jain vegetarian friendly. Would it be okay if I share some dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: That's what I'm looking for.",

        "gpt4": "I can certainly provide some suggestions, Mr. Hooper. In a cardiac diet, it's typically recommended to include a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, all while limiting salt, added sugars, and saturated and trans fats. Now, since you're following a Jain vegetarian diet, this would mean focusing on plant-based proteins like legumes and lentils, as well as plenty of fruits and vegetables that aren't grown underground. \n\nWhole grains would also be beneficial for both diets. They could include foods like brown rice, oats, and whole grain bread or pasta. As part of a cardiac diet, it's also important to limit your fluid intake to about 1.5 liters per day, and this includes any broths or soups as well.\n\nRemember, making dietary changes can be challenging, so it's perfectly okay to start small and make a few changes at a time. I encourage you to discuss these dietary changes with your dietician as well, as they can provide more tailored advice. Would you like more information on specific foods to include in your diet?",
        "our_model": "Wonderful, Mr. Hooper. For a cardiac and Jain vegetarian diet, you should focus on foods that are low in sodium and water content. This includes fresh fruits and vegetables, especially those that grow above the ground like apples, berries, and cucumbers. You can also have whole grains, legumes, and nuts. However, it's important to limit the intake of salt, oil, and certain fruits and vegetables that grow underground like potatoes and carrots due to their high water content. Does that help?"
