Do you have a favorite beach you're planning to visit, or is it more about the act of walking by the ocean?\n\nPatient: Honestly, that I'm not sure which beach I wanna go to yet.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. The important thing is the goal itself - to be able to enjoy a walk on the beach. It's a wonderful motivation for your recovery. Now, how are you feeling about your upcoming procedure?\n\nPatient: Well, I am really\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, you were saying?\n\nPatient: excited to have a new knee, of course.

        "gpt4": "Absolutely, that's a very common question. Pain can vary from person to person. Your doctor will be controlling your pain with medications like the Oxycodone that has been prescribed. It's quite effective at managing pain after a procedure like a total knee replacement. Also, keep in mind that physical therapy is a key part of recovery and can actually help reduce pain over time by strengthening your knee and improving mobility. Does that help alleviate some of your concerns, or would you like more detail on any particular aspect?",
