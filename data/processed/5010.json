I'm curious about how much pain I'm gonna be in after the procedure.\n\nNurse: It's completely normal to feel a mix of excitement and nervousness before a procedure like this. As for the pain, it's important to remember that everyone's experience is different. However, the team at O'Connor Hospital, led by your surgeon Doctor Cristina Stevens, is highly experienced and will do their best to manage your pain effectively. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No. I can't think of any, but Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. Remember, you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. Now, I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure.
