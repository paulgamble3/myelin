    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great. It's important to have that on hand for after the procedure. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol 500 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not taking anything else.\n\nNurse: Alright. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect, it's good that you've sorted that out in advance. I also wanted to clarify a very important point about your medication regimen post-procedure. You have been prescribed Tylenol 500 mg oral tablets to help manage your pain. You should take a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed, not to exceed 3000 mg per 24 hours.\n\nPlease make sure that you're not confused this with the Oxycodone prescription. Oxycodone is a stronger medication and has been prescribed as 10 mg to be taken four times a day, if necessary.\n\nIt's very important that you stick to the prescribed doses for each medication. Taking an incorrect dose could be harmful. Let's make sure you're crystal clear on this. Could you repeat back to me the instructions for these two medications? ",
