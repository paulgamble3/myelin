    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great. It's essential to have that on hand for after the procedure. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No. I have no other question.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol 500 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: Question for you. And, again, the answer is no.",

        "gpt4": "I see. I want to clarify a previous communication error. The medication that was prescribed to manage your post-surgery pain is Tylenol 500 mg oral tablet, prescribed dosage is 1000mg three times a day as needed, not Oxycodone 10mg. It's important to take the exact dose prescribed by your doctor to avoid any adverse effects. Do you take any other medications or supplements that haven't been discussed yet?",
