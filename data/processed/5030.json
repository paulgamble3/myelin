    "prompt": "Patient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: Question for you. And, again, the answer is no.\n\nNurse: Alright. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: As I said earlier, yes. I've picked up all of my prescriptions for after the surgery.\n\nPatient: Great.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol 500 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Can I ask you a question, Rachel?",
