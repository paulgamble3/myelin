    "prompt": "Patient: Question for you. And, again, the answer is no.\n\nNurse: Alright. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: As I said earlier, yes. I've picked up all of my prescriptions for after the surgery.\n\nPatient: Great.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol 500 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Can I ask you a question, Rachel?\n\nNurse: Of course. What would you like to know?\n\nPatient: Can you explain the differences between total joint replacement",

        "gpt4": "Absolutely. In a total joint replacement, an orthopedic surgeon removes the damaged parts of the joint and replace it with a prosthesis. The prosthesis can be made from metal, plastic, or ceramic and is designed to replicate the movement of a normal, healthy joint. \n\nFor example, in a total knee replacement, the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and bone from the surface of your knee joint and replaces them with a man-made surface of metal and plastic. The aim is to help the knee joint work correctly.\n\nFor hip replacements, the upper end of the thigh bone (femur) is replaced with a metal ball and a new plastic socket is placed into the pelvis, replicating the hip joint.\n\nIn either case, joint replacement surgery can relieve pain and help improve function in joints that have been damaged by disease, injury, or wear and tear.\n\nAnything else you'd like to know?",
        "our_model": "Of course. Total joint replacement, also known as arthroplasty, is a surgical procedure in which a damaged joint is removed and replaced with a prosthetic implant. In your case, it's a total knee replacement, where the damaged parts of your knee joint are removed and replaced with an artificial joint. This procedure is typically done when other treatments can no longer relieve the pain and disability caused by joint problems. The goal is to help you move your joint and get back to your daily activities. Does that help clarify things for you?"
