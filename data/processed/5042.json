    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. After you've turned the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. Remember to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Finally, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that was a lot. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No. I understand.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Ma'am.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: Yes. I will definitely be able to handle the core hexadeen scrub.",
