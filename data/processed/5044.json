Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Ma'am.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: Yes. I will definitely be able to handle the core hexadeen scrub.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a few more questions for you.
