I just have a few more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I can't think of anything.\n\nNurse: Okay. I'm going to ask you a few more questions. Firstly, have you noticed any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches recently?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: That is still the plan.",
