    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a few more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I can't think of anything.\n\nNurse: Okay. I'm going to ask you a few more questions. Firstly, have you noticed any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches recently?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: That is still the plan.\n\nNurse: Great. I just want to confirm that you've arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure. Have you managed to arrange that?\n\nPatient: My daughter is going to give me a ride and then stay with me.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect, it seems like everything is well-planned. It's essential to have a support system in place for the first days after your procedure. If, for any reason, something changes and you don't have a ride home, remember you still have time to figure that out. Does that make sense?",
        "our_model": "That's wonderful to hear. It's critical to have someone with you after the procedure. If there's anything else you need to arrange, you still have time to do so. Can I count on you to do all of this?"
