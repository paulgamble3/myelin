Give me a moment to check how I can best support you. I appreciate your patience, Mr. Koroleva. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Koroleva. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 10:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Mhmm. That's fine.",
