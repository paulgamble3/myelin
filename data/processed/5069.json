    "prompt": "Patient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Koroleva. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 10:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Mhmm. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Koroleva. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Koroleva. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Excellent. Now let's move on to the prep you'll have to do before your colonoscopy.\n\nStarting 5 days before your procedure, we ask that you stop taking any blood thinning medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, unless your primary care physician has directed you otherwise. It's also crucial that you avoid foods with small seeds such as sesame seeds, cucumbers, or tomatoes as they can interfere with the procedure.\n\nThe day before, you should only consume clear liquids like broths, teas, and jelly. You should avoid any drinks or foods that are red or purple. You will also need to start a liquid laxative regimen, typically in the afternoon or evening. This will help clear your colon for the examination.\n\nThe day of, we ask that you do not consume anything, not even water, for at least 2 hours prior to your procedure. Does all of this make sense, Mr. Koroleva?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Koroleva. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications, but I want to make sure you're ready. Can we proceed?"
