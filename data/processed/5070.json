    "prompt": "Patient: Mhmm. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Koroleva. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Koroleva. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications, but I want to make sure you're ready. Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yep.",

        "gpt4": "Perfect. So I see on your chart that you are currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day. For your upcoming colonoscopy, we will need you to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before your procedure. That means you should stop taking Xarelto on August 12. Are there any questions you have about this?",
        "our_model": "Thank you, Mr. Koroleva. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day. Given the instructions for your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?"
