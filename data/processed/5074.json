    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Koroleva. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day. Given the instructions for your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Koroleva. Do you have any questions about stopping Xarelto or any concerns about how this might affect you?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Koroleva. It's critical to avoid those medications before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "That's great, Mr. Koroleva. Now, I'd like to discuss the dietary preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, it's essential for you to begin eating a low fiber diet. That means foods like white bread, pasta, rice, well-cooked vegetables without skin, and lean meats. However, you should avoid whole grains, nuts, seeds, raw or dried fruits, and certain vegetables like broccoli or cauliflower. Does that make sense, and do you have any questions about these dietary guidelines so far?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Koroleva. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Does that make sense?"
