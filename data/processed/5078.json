    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Makes sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Koroleva. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods or is there anything you're unsure about?\n\nPatient: Hello. Yes. That makes sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Koroleva. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: No. I like rice.\n\nNurse: Rice is a great choice, Mr. Koroleva. It's low in fiber and can be quite comforting. Do you usually cook it yourself or do you have a favorite way it's prepared at a restaurant?\n\nPatient: Oh my god. I just couldn't get myself Can we please just stick to, like, what we need to talk about?",

        "gpt4": "Of course, Mr. Koroleva. We're discussing this just to make this pre-procedure diet phase a bit easier. It's quite unique because rather than focusing on high-fiber health foods, now it's a time when doctors actually want patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. That said, let's move on to the next topic which is about supplements. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?",
        "our_model": "Of course, Mr. Koroleva. I apologize if I went off-topic. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Let's move on to the next topic. Are you currently taking any supplements like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications?"
