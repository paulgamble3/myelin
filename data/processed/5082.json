Let's move on to the next topic. Are you currently taking any supplements like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Koroleva. It's critical to avoid those supplements and medications before a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Nope. I'm good.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep.
