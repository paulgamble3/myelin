        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Koroleva. You don't have to do anything just yet, but for your colonoscopy, you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves not eating any solid foods and drinking either clear or light-colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Does that seem doable?",

Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?"
