    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: I hear you, Mr. Koroleva. It's common to feel a bit apprehensive about the bowel prep. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure. Rachel. Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Koroleva. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: Nope.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Koroleva. I'm glad to hear that you understand the clear liquid diet. Let's move onto the other main step to remember: drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. Then, you'll wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?",
