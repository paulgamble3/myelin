    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Koroleva. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. If you change your mind or have any questions about the bowel prep, don't hesitate to ask. Some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. Do you have any other questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. Let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure.
