    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. If you change your mind or have any questions about the bowel prep, don't hesitate to ask. Some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. Do you have any other questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. Let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have 2 more questions for you. Before we move on, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",
