    "prompt": "Nurse: At-home stool tests, also known as fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), are designed to detect hidden blood in the stool, which can be an early sign of colon cancer. They are quite accurate in finding cancers that are in the colon, but they may not be as effective in finding cancers in the upper part of the colon. That's why procedures like colonoscopies are still considered the gold standard for colon cancer screening. They allow doctors to directly examine the entire colon and take tissue samples if needed. Does that help answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could provide some insight. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy as a preventative screening for colon cancer. It can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm ready to get it over with. I've done it before, so\n\nNurse: I can imagine that it's a relief to know what to expect, even though the procedure itself might not be something you're looking forward to. I'm glad you're taking this step to take care of your health. Before we move on, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, if any questions come up during our conversation, feel free to ask at any time. I'm here to help. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great. My aim today is to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. You will also be able to go over any questions and get the clear instructions you need for your procedure. I'll be calling you again the day before your procedure just to make sure everything is in order. Now, let's start by discussing your current medication, the Tylenol 500 mg that you're taking. Have there been any changes to this medication recently?",
        "our_model": "Great, let's start with your diet. A few days before the procedure, you'll need to start a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. The day before the procedure, you'll need to switch to a clear liquid diet. This includes broths, clear juices, water, coffee or tea without milk, and gelatin desserts. It's essential to avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. Does that make sense so far?"
