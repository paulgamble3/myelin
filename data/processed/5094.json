Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Koroleva. It's important to have someone available to take you home after the procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the day of the procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over the logistics, your medication adjustments, diet changes, and bowel prep. You've confirmed that you're feeling well and have arranged a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
