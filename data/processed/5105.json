    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, if any questions come up during our conversation, feel free to ask at any time. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy as a preventative screening for colon cancer. It can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I feel okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay about it. It's really important to take these steps for your health. I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the information you're looking for. Would it be alright if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our list. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Can you repeat that, please?\n\nNurse: Of course, I apologize if I wasn't clear. I'm asking about the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy. Are you clear on what you should and shouldn't eat during this time?\n\nPatient: I am. Thank you.",

Is that okay with you, Patient?",
