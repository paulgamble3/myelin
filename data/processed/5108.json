    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, I apologize if I wasn't clear. I'm asking about the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy. Are you clear on what you should and shouldn't eat during this time?\n\nPatient: I am. Thank you.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know about the day of the procedure?\n\nPatient: No. Not really.",
