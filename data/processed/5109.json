    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's fine.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know about the day of the procedure?\n\nPatient: No. Not really.\n\nNurse: Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes. I'm ready.",
