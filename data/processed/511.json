    "prompt": "Nurse: I can imagine that it's a relief to know what to expect, even though the procedure itself might not be something you're looking forward to. I'm glad you're taking this step to take care of your health. Before we move on, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, if any questions come up during our conversation, feel free to ask at any time. I'm here to help. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, let's start with your diet. A few days before the procedure, you'll need to start a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. The day before the procedure, you'll need to switch to a clear liquid diet. This includes broths, clear juices, water, coffee or tea without milk, and gelatin desserts. It's essential to avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. Does that make sense so far?\n\nPatient: It does.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Now, let's get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: I will be there.",
