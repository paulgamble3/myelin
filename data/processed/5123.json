    "prompt": "Nurse: That's wonderful! Homemade bread is always a treat. Just remember to avoid whole grains in your recipe for the next few days. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other favorite low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. It's good to have at least one comfort food that you enjoy. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You'll need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to avoid these types of supplements and medications as they can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I feel I feel okay.",
