    "prompt": "Nurse: That's perfectly fine. It's good to have at least one comfort food that you enjoy. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You'll need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to avoid these types of supplements and medications as they can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I feel I feel okay.\n\nNurse: I hear that you're feeling okay about the clear liquid diet and the GoLYTELY laxative solution. It's great that you're feeling positive about this. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",

        "gpt4": "Okay. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?",
