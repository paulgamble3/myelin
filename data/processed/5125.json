    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to avoid these types of supplements and medications as they can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I feel I feel okay.\n\nNurse: I hear that you're feeling okay about the clear liquid diet and the GoLYTELY laxative solution. It's great that you're feeling positive about this. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. Remember, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: It's okay. I got a cover. I know what that is.",

It's important to note that examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. But it seems like you understand this very well. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?",
