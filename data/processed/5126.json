    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I feel I feel okay.\n\nNurse: I hear that you're feeling okay about the clear liquid diet and the GoLYTELY laxative solution. It's great that you're feeling positive about this. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. Remember, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: It's okay. I got a cover. I know what that is.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's important to be clear on what you can have during this time. Just to confirm, some examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: No. I don't. Thank you.",

You'll need to start drinking the first half of the solution around 6 PM the evening before your procedure. Then you'll wake up early on the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. This might seem challenging, but many people find ways to make it easier. Would you like to hear some tips on making the bowel prep easier?",
