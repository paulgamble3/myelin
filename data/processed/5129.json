    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. It's important to be clear on what you can have during this time. Just to confirm, some examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: No. I don't. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. If any questions come up later, feel free to ask. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Here are a couple of tips that might help. You can drink the laxative solution cold. This can make it more palatable. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: Sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you found the tips helpful. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",

        "gpt4": "Alright. Some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine. However, if you do experience any difficulty or discomfort, please let your care team know so they can provide guidance and support. If it's alright with you, we can now move onto the next key part of your colonoscopy prep \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd NPO or when to stop eating and drinking everything before the procedure. Can we proceed to that?",
        "our_model": "Alright. If any questions come up later, feel free to ask. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Does that make sense?"
