    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, let's start with your diet. A few days before the procedure, you'll need to start a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. The day before the procedure, you'll need to switch to a clear liquid diet. This includes broths, clear juices, water, coffee or tea without milk, and gelatin desserts. It's essential to avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. Does that make sense so far?\n\nPatient: It does.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Now, let's get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: I will be there.\n\nNurse: Perfect, thank you for confirming. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Is there anything else about the logistics that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",
