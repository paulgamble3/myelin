    "prompt": "Nurse: You're welcome. If any questions come up later, feel free to ask. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. Here are a couple of tips that might help. You can drink the laxative solution cold. This can make it more palatable. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: Sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you found the tips helpful. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright. If any questions come up later, feel free to ask. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does.",
