    "prompt": "Nurse: Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that the logistics are clear. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. There's no need to stop this medication before your colonoscopy. Are you clear on this?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Swell. Besides Tylenol, are you taking any other medications? Specifically, we would need to know if you're taking Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners since they typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy. Is there any medication like this that you're currently taking?",
        "our_model": "Excellent. Do you have any questions about your Tylenol medication?"
