Is there anything else about the logistics that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, I'm glad to hear that. I'm going to move on to talk about your medications, but I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.\n\nNurse: Great, I see on your chart that you're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. There's no need to stop this medication before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this medication?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I am not.",
