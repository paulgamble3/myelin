    "prompt": "Nurse: a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other favorite low fiber foods or any questions about the diet?\n\nPatient: Oh, I said I like white bread.\n\nNurse: White bread is also a good choice. It's great that you're aware of these low fiber foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or shall we move on to discuss supplements?\n\nPatient: You can move on.\n\nNurse: Alright. You will also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I am not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Do you have any questions about why it's necessary to stop these supplements or any other questions related to this topic?\n\nPatient: No.",
