    "prompt": "Nurse: White bread is also a good choice. It's great that you're aware of these low fiber foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or shall we move on to discuss supplements?\n\nPatient: You can move on.\n\nNurse: Alright. You will also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I am not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Do you have any questions about why it's necessary to stop these supplements or any other questions related to this topic?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: But I'm grateful I can get it done.",

        "gpt4": "That's a very positive outlook, Patient. This prep process is key for a successful colonoscopy and your attitude will certainly help. When it comes to the clear liquid diet, you do not have to start it just yet. But you will need to begin 24 hours before your procedure. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light-colored beverages, but nothing with any red or purple dye. Shall I share some examples of suitable clear liquids?",
        "our_model": "I appreciate your positive attitude. It's great that you're taking this step for your health. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?"
