    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. You will also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I am not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Do you have any questions about why it's necessary to stop these supplements or any other questions related to this topic?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: But I'm grateful I can get it done.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your positive attitude. It's great that you're taking this step for your health. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Alright. Remember, you don't have to do anything just yet. You'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Are you alright with me sharing some examples of clear liquids?",
