    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: But I'm grateful I can get it done.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your positive attitude. It's great that you're taking this step for your health. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's essential to note that you should avoid any liquids that are red or purple. Do you have any questions about these examples or any other questions about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: Well, no. I think I've got it figured out.",

        "our_model": "That's great to hear. Remember, the clear liquid diet is crucial for the success of your colonoscopy. Now, let's move on to the other main step to remember, which is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?"
