    "prompt": "Nurse: Great. Here are a couple of tips that might help. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it easier to drink. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. Do you have any questions about these tips or the bowel prep in general?\n\nPatient: No. You've already asked that.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the repetition. I'm here to make this process as easy as possible for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. The last part of your prep is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. Not that I could think of.",
