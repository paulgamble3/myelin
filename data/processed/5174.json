    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize for the repetition. I'm here to make this process as easy as possible for you. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. The last part of your prep is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Excellent. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. Not that I could think of.\n\nNurse: Alright. I appreciate your patience. My next question is about your current health status. Have you been experiencing any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No. No. Not at all.",
