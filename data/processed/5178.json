    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's important to have someone available to take you home after the procedure since you'll be sedated and it's not safe to drive or take public transportation. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't have any other questions.\n\nNurse: Alright. That was all the topics for today. Before we end this call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over the dietary restrictions, your medication, and the bowel prep. You've confirmed that you're clear on all these instructions and have arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yes?",
