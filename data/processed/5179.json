    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. It's important to have someone available to take you home after the procedure since you'll be sedated and it's not safe to drive or take public transportation. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't have any other questions.\n\nNurse: Alright. That was all the topics for today. Before we end this call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over the dietary restrictions, your medication, and the bowel prep. You've confirmed that you're clear on all these instructions and have arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yes?\n\nNurse: Wonderful. I want to remind you that I'm here for you every step of the way. I will call you again the day before the procedure to go over step by step all the prep instructions. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, you can call us back at 641-381-6523. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
