Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to your medications. I see that you have a new prescription for Lasix 20 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 40 mg twice a day. Have you been able to pick up this medication from the pharmacy?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
