    "prompt": "Nurse: Poodle sounds like a wonderful companion. What's your favorite thing to do with Poodle?\n\nPatient: We like to go to the dog's park.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a great time! Dog parks can be such a fun place for both you and Poodle. Now, I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Molly Burke and I have a few topics to cover with you. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to your medications. I see that you have a new prescription for Lasix 20 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 40 mg twice a day. Have you been able to pick up this medication from the pharmacy?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. And how have you been taking your Lasix?\n\nPatient: Orally",

        "gpt4": "That's correct. You should be taking 40 mg of Lasix two times a day as per the doctor's instructions. Now, I'd like to briefly go over your existing medications. On your list is Digoxin, Enalapril, Sumpatriptan, and Triamcinolone ointment. Are you still taking these medications?",
        "our_model": "That's correct. You're taking it orally, but I meant to ask if you've been taking it twice a day as prescribed. Have you been able to follow this schedule?"
