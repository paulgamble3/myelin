    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, let's move on to your medications. I see that you have a new prescription for Lasix 20 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 40 mg twice a day. Have you been able to pick up this medication from the pharmacy?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. And how have you been taking your Lasix?\n\nPatient: Orally\n\nNurse: That's correct. You're taking it orally, but I meant to ask if you've been taking it twice a day as prescribed. Have you been able to follow this schedule?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Now, let's briefly discuss your existing medications. Are you still taking Digoxin, Enalapril, Sumpatriptan, Triamcinolone ointment, Metformin, Riboflavin, Atorvastatin, Lantus, Tramadol, Levothyroxine, and Tylenol as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
