    "prompt": "Nurse: Wonderful. And how have you been taking your Lasix?\n\nPatient: Orally\n\nNurse: That's correct. You're taking it orally, but I meant to ask if you've been taking it twice a day as prescribed. Have you been able to follow this schedule?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Now, let's briefly discuss your existing medications. Are you still taking Digoxin, Enalapril, Sumpatriptan, Triamcinolone ointment, Metformin, Riboflavin, Atorvastatin, Lantus, Tramadol, Levothyroxine, and Tylenol as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's critical to keep up with your medications. I understand that it can sometimes be challenging to remember all the doses and timings. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No. I use the pull box.",
