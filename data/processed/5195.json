    "prompt": "Nurse: That's correct. You're taking it orally, but I meant to ask if you've been taking it twice a day as prescribed. Have you been able to follow this schedule?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Now, let's briefly discuss your existing medications. Are you still taking Digoxin, Enalapril, Sumpatriptan, Triamcinolone ointment, Metformin, Riboflavin, Atorvastatin, Lantus, Tramadol, Levothyroxine, and Tylenol as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's critical to keep up with your medications. I understand that it can sometimes be challenging to remember all the doses and timings. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No. I use the pull box.\n\nNurse: That's a great strategy. Using a pill box can be very helpful in managing multiple medications. You're doing a great job. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I guess.",
