    "prompt": "Nurse: That's excellent, Ms. Ware. It's essential to keep up with your medications. I understand that sometimes it can be challenging to remember all the doses. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: And\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Ware, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: No. For goodness' lasix. I'm not an idiot.\n\nNurse: I apologize if I gave you that impression, Ms. Ware. I'm here to support you, not judge you. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, with your permission, I'd like to ask a few questions about your symptoms to understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. Ware. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: No.",
