    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, let's smoothly transition back to the diet prep for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to eat a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and raw fruits or vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: No. I do not.\n\nNurse: Great, I'm glad that's clear. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Rice.\n\nNurse: Rice is a great choice for a low fiber diet. It's easy to digest and can be quite comforting. Do you usually prepare it in a specific way that you enjoy?\n\nPatient: Just the regular way.\n\nNurse: That sounds simple and delicious. It's not often that doctors recommend eating low fiber comfort foods, but in this case, it's exactly what's needed for your colonoscopy prep. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the diet or anything else?\n\nPatient: No.",
