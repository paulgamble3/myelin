    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you. Given your health conditions, it's recommended that you follow a cardiac low sodium diet. This means limiting foods high in sodium, like processed foods, and choosing more fresh fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. It's also recommended that you limit your fluid intake to 2 liters per day. This includes all fluids, not just water. Lastly, I see that you're lactose intolerant. It's essential to avoid foods that contain lactose, as they can cause digestive issues. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Based on what you've shared about your diet, it sounds like you're already making some good choices. One suggestion could be to check food labels for sodium content, especially in processed foods. It's also important to be mindful of your fluid intake, including all fluids, not just water. Lastly, continue to avoid foods that contain lactose. Do you think these suggestions are manageable for you?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Remember, these changes can have a big impact on your health. Now, let's talk about exercise. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: I go to Pilates every day.\n\nNurse: That's fantastic! Pilates is a great way to stay active. How long have you been doing Pilates?\n\nPatient: Okay. About two years.",
