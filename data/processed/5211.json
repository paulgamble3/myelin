One suggestion could be to check food labels for sodium content, especially in processed foods. It's also important to be mindful of your fluid intake, including all fluids, not just water. Lastly, continue to avoid foods that contain lactose. Do you think these suggestions are manageable for you?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Remember, these changes can have a big impact on your health. Now, let's talk about exercise. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: I go to Pilates every day.\n\nNurse: That's fantastic! Pilates is a great way to stay active. How long have you been doing Pilates?\n\nPatient: Okay. About two years.\n\nNurse: That's impressive! Sticking with an exercise routine for two years is a great achievement. Can I provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner?\n\nPatient: I don't see how a robot is gonna be able to give me good recommendations for exercise.",
