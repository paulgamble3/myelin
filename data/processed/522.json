    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, I'm glad that's clear. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Rice.\n\nNurse: Rice is a great choice for a low fiber diet. It's easy to digest and can be quite comforting. Do you usually prepare it in a specific way that you enjoy?\n\nPatient: Just the regular way.\n\nNurse: That sounds simple and delicious. It's not often that doctors recommend eating low fiber comfort foods, but in this case, it's exactly what's needed for your colonoscopy prep. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the diet or anything else?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You'll need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No. I am not.",
