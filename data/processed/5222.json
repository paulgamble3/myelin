        "gpt4": "I appreciate your inquiry, Mr. Oliver. While I don't have the exact sodium content in front of me, bottled salad dressings can often contain a significant amount of sodium. It can be a good idea to check the nutrition label for information specific to the Wishbone Italian dressing. Would you like us to discuss other ways to manage your sodium intake, particularly in relation to your kidney health?",

However, I would recommend checking the nutrition label on the bottle for the sodium content. It's critical to monitor your sodium intake, especially with your conditions. Would you like me to note this for your care team to review?"
