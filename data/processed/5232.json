    "prompt": "Patient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Oliver. One way to manage your blood pressure is by reducing your salt intake. As you mentioned earlier, it's important to check the sodium content in your salad dressing. Another strategy is regular physical activity, such as a daily walk. Lastly, maintaining a healthy weight can also help manage your blood pressure. Do you have any questions about these suggestions?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Oliver. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: I actually do.\n\nPatient: What the g s\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Oliver. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Your GFR is 67 mL/min/1.73m2, which is within the normal range. This means your kidneys are functioning well. Do you have any other questions about your lab results?\n\nPatient: far means and how it is measured.",

        "gpt4": "Sure, Mr. Oliver. The Glomerular Filtration Rate, or GFR, is a measure of how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. It's calculated from your blood test results, age, body size and gender. A lower GFR can indicate that your kidney function is decreased. However, your GFR of 67 mL/min/1.73m\ufffd\ufffd shows that your kidneys are functioning properly. Does that help clarify what the GFR is?",
        "our_model": "Absolutely, Mr. Oliver. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A GFR of 67 mL/min/1.73m2, like yours, is within the normal range, which is a good sign. Does that help clarify things for you?"
