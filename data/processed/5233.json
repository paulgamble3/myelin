It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Your GFR is 67 mL/min/1.73m2, which is within the normal range. This means your kidneys are functioning well. Do you have any other questions about your lab results?\n\nPatient: far means and how it is measured.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Oliver. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A GFR of 67 mL/min/1.73m2, like yours, is within the normal range, which is a good sign. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Thank you, Rachel.",
