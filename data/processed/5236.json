    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Oliver. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A GFR of 67 mL/min/1.73m2, like yours, is within the normal range, which is a good sign. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Thank you, Rachel.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Oliver. I'm glad I could help. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently prescribed Valsartan 40 mg oral tablet, which you should be taking daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Oliver. Sticking to your medication schedule is crucial for managing your conditions. Now, let's move on to your next medication. You're also prescribed Lantus 100 IU/mL prefilled pen, with a dosage of 15 units two times a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Oliver. Regularly taking your Lantus as prescribed is important for managing your blood sugar levels. Lastly, you're prescribed Aspart 100 IU/mL prefilled pen, with a dosage of 5 units three times a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.",

        "gpt4": "Good job, Mr. Oliver. Staying on top of your medications contributes significantly to managing your health. Remember though, there are supplements and even over the counter medications that aren't safe for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease. Always consult your doctor before starting any new medication or supplement. Do you have any questions about this?",
        "our_model": "That's wonderful, Mr. Oliver. It's essential to take your Aspart as prescribed to help manage your blood sugar levels. I understand that it can be challenging to remember to take medications on time. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications?"
