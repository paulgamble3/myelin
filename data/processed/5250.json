    "prompt": "Patient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Oliver. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices?\n\nPatient: I do smoke a pack of cigarettes a day.\n\nPatient: But I'm not going to quit.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Oliver. Quitting smoking is a personal decision and can be a challenging process. Could you share with me why you feel you're not ready to quit at this time?\n\nPatient: It just helps me relax.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Oliver. Smoking can sometimes be a way to cope with stress. However, it's important to remember that smoking can have a negative impact on your health, especially with your chronic conditions. If you ever decide to quit, there are many resources available to help you. Would you like me to share some of these resources with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.",

Your primary health care provider can also provide useful resources and guidance. Remember, it's completely okay to seek help and it's never too late to quit. Are there any questions you would like to ask about these resources or about quitting in general?",
