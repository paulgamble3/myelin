Quitting smoking is a personal decision and can be a challenging process. Could you share with me why you feel you're not ready to quit at this time?\n\nPatient: It just helps me relax.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Oliver. Smoking can sometimes be a way to cope with stress. However, it's important to remember that smoking can have a negative impact on your health, especially with your chronic conditions. If you ever decide to quit, there are many resources available to help you. Would you like me to share some of these resources with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Oliver. There are many resources available to help you quit smoking, including nicotine replacement therapies, medications, and counseling services. You can also consider joining a support group or using a quit-smoking app. Remember, it's never too late to quit, and every attempt to quit, even if not successful, can lead to a future successful quit attempt. Do you have any questions about these resources?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",
