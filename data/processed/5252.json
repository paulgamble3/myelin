    "prompt": "Patient: It just helps me relax.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Oliver. Smoking can sometimes be a way to cope with stress. However, it's important to remember that smoking can have a negative impact on your health, especially with your chronic conditions. If you ever decide to quit, there are many resources available to help you. Would you like me to share some of these resources with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Oliver. There are many resources available to help you quit smoking, including nicotine replacement therapies, medications, and counseling services. You can also consider joining a support group or using a quit-smoking app. Remember, it's never too late to quit, and every attempt to quit, even if not successful, can lead to a future successful quit attempt. Do you have any questions about these resources?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Oliver. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",

        "gpt4": "Okay, Mr. Oliver. Here's a summary of what we discussed. You've been managing your blood sugar levels well and your recent reading was within the target range. You've also been taking your prescribed medications regularly. You shared that you've been eating healthier meals, such as chicken soup with vegetables. We discussed some dietary suggestions to help manage your conditions and you agreed to be mindful of the sodium content in your food. Nevertheless, you mentioned that you smoke a pack of cigarettes a day for relaxation, and while you're not ready to quit yet, you were receptive to receiving resources for stopping smoking in the future. Can we count on you to maintain these efforts and consider the suggestions and resources provided?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Mr. Oliver. To summarize, you've agreed to continue monitoring your blood sugar and blood pressure, and to consider the DASH diet for your meals. You're also planning to check the sodium content in your salad dressing. Can I count on you to do these things?"
