    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to avoid those supplements and medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or anything else?\n\nPatient: No. I understand.\n\nNurse: Great, I'm glad that's clear. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I've done it before, so\n\nNurse: I see, you're a pro at this. It's true that many people find the procedure itself to be no problem\n\nPatient: I know that it's not fun, but I'm ready to get it over with.\n\nNurse: at all, I hear you, it's definitely not the most enjoyable part of the process, but it's necessary for a successful procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the prep?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "That's good to hear. Now, just a friendly reminder - you don't have to start this step just yet. You'll need to start your clear liquid diet and drinking GoLYTELY laxative solution 24 hours before your procedure. For clarity, the clear liquid diet involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Could I share some examples of what clear liquids you can have?",
