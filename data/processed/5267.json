    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Rivers, I didn't catch your last blood sugar reading. Could you please repeat it?\n\nPatient: One thirty two.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Rivers. A blood sugar level of 132 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes. Would it be okay if I share some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Rivers. One strategy to help manage your blood sugar levels is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, and incorporating a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Another strategy is regular physical activity, which can help your body use insulin more effectively. Lastly, it's important to take your prescribed medications as directed by your doctor. Do you have any questions about these strategies or anything else related to your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: No. Do wanna point out that you keep calling me, mister, and I'm a woman.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion, Ms. Rivers. I appreciate you pointing that out. Now, could you please tell me when you took your last blood pressure measurement and what the result was?\n\nPatient: I took it today. It was ninety over one twenty.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Rivers. Your blood pressure reading is a little inverted. A healthy blood pressure reading is usually something like 120 over 80, where the first number (the systolic pressure) is higher. Could you please double check your numbers?",
