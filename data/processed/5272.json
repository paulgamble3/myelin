        "gpt4": "I see, thank you for clarifying, Ms. Rivers. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen. This is a waste product that your kidneys usually remove from your blood. A high level of BUN can indicate that your kidneys are working less effectively than they should be.\n\nCreatinine is a waste product produced by your muscles. Just like BUN, your kidneys usually remove it from your blood. If the creatinine levels are high, it can also suggest that your kidneys aren't working as well as they should be. \n\nYour recent blood tests show BUN at 6.87mmol/L and creatinine at 0.8mg/dL, both within normal range, which is reassuring. Does that help clear up your question, Ms. Rivers?",

A high BUN level could indicate that your kidneys aren't working as well as they should be. Creatinine is another waste product that your kidneys filter out. A high creatinine level could also indicate kidney problems. Does that help clarify things for you?"
