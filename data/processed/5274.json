    "prompt": "Patient: What does bun mean and what does creatine mean?\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion, Ms. Rivers. Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: On my blood work, There's something that says b u n, and then there's another one that says prazaminin.\n\nPatient: What do they mean?\n\nNurse: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Rivers. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen. It's a waste product that's produced in your body and is filtered out by your kidneys. A high BUN level could indicate that your kidneys aren't working as well as they should be. Creatinine is another waste product that your kidneys filter out. A high creatinine level could also indicate kidney problems. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Rivers. If you have any other questions about your lab results, feel free to ask.\n\nPatient: Yeah.",

Let's start with the first one, Captopril. This medication is prescribed at a dosage of 25 mg daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?",
