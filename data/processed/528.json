    "prompt": "Nurse: I see, you're a pro at this. It's true that many people find the procedure itself to be no problem\n\nPatient: I know that it's not fun, but I'm ready to get it over with.\n\nNurse: at all, I hear you, it's definitely not the most enjoyable part of the process, but it's necessary for a successful procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the prep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on. You don't have to do anything just yet, but you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure. This involves drinking only clear liquids, which means no solid foods and drinking either clear or light-colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: I don't really need that\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. If you have any questions later on, feel free to ask. Just to give you an idea, clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light-colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: you know, in-depth instruction. I've done a colonoscopy in the past. So I do understand.",

        "gpt4": "Absolutely, we're just here to support and remind you of any key steps. The other main step to remember for your bowel prep is drinking the GoLYTELY laxative solution. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM the night before your procedure. You'll then wake up early on the morning of your procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips to make this bowel prep go smoother?",
