    "prompt": "Nurse: at all, I hear you, it's definitely not the most enjoyable part of the process, but it's necessary for a successful procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the prep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, let's move on. You don't have to do anything just yet, but you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure. This involves drinking only clear liquids, which means no solid foods and drinking either clear or light-colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: I don't really need that\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. If you have any questions later on, feel free to ask. Just to give you an idea, clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light-colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: you know, in-depth instruction. I've done a colonoscopy in the past. So I do understand.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your patience, and I'm glad to hear that you're familiar with the process. Just to confirm, you're comfortable with the clear liquid diet instructions, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great. The other main step is drinking the laxative GoLYTELY solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of the solution around 6 PM. Then, on the morning of your colonoscopy, you'll need to wake up early to finish drinking the second half. Would you be open to some tips on making the bowel prep easier?",
