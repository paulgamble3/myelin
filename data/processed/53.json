I'm not an idiot.\n\nNurse: I apologize if I gave you that impression, Ms. Ware. I'm here to support you, not judge you. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, with your permission, I'd like to ask a few questions about your symptoms to understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Ms. Ware. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Ware.
