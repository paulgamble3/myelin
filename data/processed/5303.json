It's not gonna a good, you know, mental health day.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're having a tough day, Mr. Weeks. It's completely normal to have ups and downs, especially after a hospital stay. Is there anything in particular you're looking forward to doing now that you're home?\n\nPatient: Not really.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Weeks. Sometimes, it's just nice to be back in our own space. By the way, do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy?\n\nPatient: Not really any that I enjoy at the moment.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Weeks. It's okay to have periods where we don't feel like doing much. How about the weather?\n\nPatient: What about the weather?",
