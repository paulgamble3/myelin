    "prompt": "Nurse: I see, Mr. Weeks. It's okay to have periods where we don't feel like doing much. How about the weather?\n\nPatient: What about the weather?\n\nNurse: I was just wondering if there's any particular type of weather that you enjoy, Mr. Weeks?\n\nPatient: I guess, sunny days.\n\nNurse: Sunny days can indeed be quite uplifting, Mr. Weeks. Now, I have a few topics to cover with you on behalf of Doctor Stapleton. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Weeks. Let's move on to your medications. Are you still taking your Carvedilol and Lasix tablets?\n\nPatient: Yeah. There's too many meds to take, though.",

        "gpt4": "It's understandable to feel overwhelmed with multiple medications, Mr. Weeks. Remember each one plays an important role in managing your CHF. Can I give some suggestions to make it easier to keep track of the medications, would that be alright?",
