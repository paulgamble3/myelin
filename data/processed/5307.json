Now, I have a few topics to cover with you on behalf of Doctor Stapleton. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Weeks. Let's move on to your medications. Are you still taking your Carvedilol and Lasix tablets?\n\nPatient: Yeah. There's too many meds to take, though.\n\nNurse: I can understand how managing multiple medications can feel overwhelming, Mr. Weeks. It's quite common to feel this way. Are you also continuing with your Zoloft?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
