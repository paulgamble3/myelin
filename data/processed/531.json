    "prompt": "Nurse: That's perfectly fine. If you have any questions later on, feel free to ask. Just to give you an idea, clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light-colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: you know, in-depth instruction. I've done a colonoscopy in the past. So I do understand.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your patience, and I'm glad to hear that you're familiar with the process. Just to confirm, you're comfortable with the clear liquid diet instructions, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you for confirming. Now, let's discuss the other main step to remember, which is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6 PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No. Thank you. As I said, I've done it before.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your patience, and I'm glad to hear that you're familiar with the process. Just to confirm, you're comfortable with the instructions for drinking the GoLYTELY laxative solution, correct?\n\nPatient: Correct.",
