    "prompt": "Nurse: I can understand how managing multiple medications can feel overwhelming, Mr. Weeks. It's quite common to feel this way. Are you also continuing with your Zoloft?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Mr. Weeks. It's critical to keep up with your medications. I understand it can be challenging. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Weeks. You're doing a fantastic job managing your medications. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: I guess.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Weeks. Let's start with your breathing. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: No.",
