    "prompt": "Nurse: That sounds lovely, Mr. Gardner. Pets can bring so much joy. What kind of fish do you have and what's their name?\n\nPatient: I have a goldfish.\n\nNurse: Goldfish are quite fascinating, aren't they?\n\nPatient: And her name is Rachel.\n\nNurse: That's a beautiful name for a goldfish, Mr. Gardner. It must be nice to have Rachel the goldfish to keep you company. Now, I have a few topics to cover with you on behalf of Doctor Thornton. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: No. You can just go ahead. And if I have any questions, I'll ask.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Gardner. Let's start with your new medication. Have you been able to pick up your Lasix 20 mg oral tablets from the pharmacy?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
