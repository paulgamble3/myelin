    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner. I thought I heard you say you've been using more pillows to sleep. Could you please confirm that?\n\nPatient: I said no.\n\nNurse: I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you. Give me a moment to check how I can best support you. I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Gardner. Thank you for confirming. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep track of these symptoms at home every day. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No. I've been managing my CHF for a long time.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Gardner. It's great that you're familiar with managing your CHF. Now, let's talk about your diet. Can you tell me about your recent meals?\n\nPatient: One moment, please.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Gardner. Take your time. I'm interested in hearing about what you've been eating recently. [\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sorry. I had to yell at my goldfish Yes. Catcher's been trying to eat pretty healthy.",
