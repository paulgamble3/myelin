    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, Mr. Gardner. Take your time. I'm interested in hearing about what you've been eating recently. [\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sorry. I had to yell at my goldfish Yes. Catcher's been trying to eat pretty healthy.\n\nNurse: It sounds like you're making an effort to eat healthily, Mr. Gardner. That's great. Can you share a bit more about what you typically eat in a day?\n\nPatient: I try to eat a lot of salad and fruits and vegetables?\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Gardner. Salads, fruits, and vegetables are excellent choices. Can you tell me more about the types of dressings or seasonings you use on your salads?\n\nPatient: Oh, I don't really pay attention to that.\n\nNurse: That's okay, Mr. Gardner. It's essential to enjoy what we eat. Now, I'd like to remind you of your dietary recommendations. You're on a 1.5 Liter Fluid restriction and a 1500 mg Sodium Restricted diet. Can I share some tips on how to follow these recommendations?\n\nPatient: Okay.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Gardner. Regarding your fluid restriction, it's important to account for not only the beverages you drink, but also foods that have a high water content like soup, fruits, and some vegetables. As for the sodium restriction, being mindful of the types of seasonings and sauces you use can really make a difference. Many dressings and canned or packaged foods contain high levels of sodium. You could consider using herbs, spices, or vinegar for flavor instead. \n\nThese are the basic ideas, Mr. Gardner. I hope this can help make managing your restrictions a bit less daunting. Do you have any questions or concerns so far?",
        "our_model": "Wonderful, Mr. Gardner. For your fluid restriction, it's important to measure your drinks to ensure you're not exceeding the 1.5 liter limit. This includes all fluids, not just water. As for your sodium restriction, it's a good idea to avoid processed foods and add less salt to your meals. Also, try to use herbs and spices for flavor instead of salt. Does that make sense?"
