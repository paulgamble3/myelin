    "prompt": "Nurse: That's okay, Mr. Gardner. It's essential to enjoy what we eat. Now, I'd like to remind you of your dietary recommendations. You're on a 1.5 Liter Fluid restriction and a 1500 mg Sodium Restricted diet. Can I share some tips on how to follow these recommendations?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Mr. Gardner. For your fluid restriction, it's important to measure your drinks to ensure you're not exceeding the 1.5 liter limit. This includes all fluids, not just water. As for your sodium restriction, it's a good idea to avoid processed foods and add less salt to your meals. Also, try to use herbs and spices for flavor instead of salt. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Gardner. I'm glad I could provide some helpful tips. Now, let's talk about exercise. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: Actually, I had a question.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Gardner. What's your question?\n\nPatient: I am not really sure how to measure the one point five liters you're talking about.",

        "gpt4": "Of course, Mr. Gardner. To measure 1.5 liters, it might be helpful to know that 1.5 liters is approximately equal to six 8-ounce cups. So during your day, try to limit your combined total intake of fluids - this includes water, coffee, tea, soup, fruits with high water content etc. - to no more than six 8-ounce cups. Does that help clarify things for you?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question, Mr. Gardner. To measure 1.5 liters, you can use a water bottle with measurements on the side. A 1.5-liter water bottle would be the exact amount. For reference, a standard 2-liter soda bottle is just a bit more than your daily fluid limit. Does that help clarify things?"
