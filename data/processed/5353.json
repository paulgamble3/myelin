    "prompt": "Nurse: You're welcome, Mr. Gardner. I'm glad I could provide some helpful tips. Now, let's talk about exercise. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: Actually, I had a question.\n\nNurse: Of course, Mr. Gardner. What's your question?\n\nPatient: I am not really sure how to measure the one point five liters you're talking about.\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Gardner. To measure 1.5 liters, you can use a water bottle with measurements on the side. A 1.5-liter water bottle would be the exact amount. For reference, a standard 2-liter soda bottle is just a bit more than your daily fluid limit. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Okay. Yeah. It does. I'll have to get a water bottle.\n\nNurse: I'm glad That sounds like a good plan, Mr. Gardner. Now, let's talk about your exercise routine. Can you tell me what you currently do for exercise?\n\nPatient: Sure. I usually just walk around my neighborhood.",
