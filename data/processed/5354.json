    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, Mr. Gardner. What's your question?\n\nPatient: I am not really sure how to measure the one point five liters you're talking about.\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Gardner. To measure 1.5 liters, you can use a water bottle with measurements on the side. A 1.5-liter water bottle would be the exact amount. For reference, a standard 2-liter soda bottle is just a bit more than your daily fluid limit. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Okay. Yeah. It does. I'll have to get a water bottle.\n\nNurse: I'm glad That sounds like a good plan, Mr. Gardner. Now, let's talk about your exercise routine. Can you tell me what you currently do for exercise?\n\nPatient: Sure. I usually just walk around my neighborhood.\n\nNurse: That's a great way to stay active, Mr. Gardner. How often do you go for walks and how long are they typically?\n\nPatient: Usually, every day for thirty minutes.",

        "gpt4": "That sounds like a good routine, Mr. Gardner. Walking is a wonderful way to build cardiovascular health. Would it be alright if I provided some additional recommendations for exercise that would be appropriate for someone with your CHF diagnosis?",
        "our_model": "That's excellent, Mr. Gardner. Walking daily for thirty minutes is a great routine. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations to help you continue to improve your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Is that alright?"
