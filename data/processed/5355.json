    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great question, Mr. Gardner. To measure 1.5 liters, you can use a water bottle with measurements on the side. A 1.5-liter water bottle would be the exact amount. For reference, a standard 2-liter soda bottle is just a bit more than your daily fluid limit. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Okay. Yeah. It does. I'll have to get a water bottle.\n\nNurse: I'm glad That sounds like a good plan, Mr. Gardner. Now, let's talk about your exercise routine. Can you tell me what you currently do for exercise?\n\nPatient: Sure. I usually just walk around my neighborhood.\n\nNurse: That's a great way to stay active, Mr. Gardner. How often do you go for walks and how long are they typically?\n\nPatient: Usually, every day for thirty minutes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Gardner. Walking daily for thirty minutes is a great routine. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations to help you continue to improve your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Okay.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. Gardner. One suggestion could be to incorporate small intervals of increased pace during your walk, say every ten minutes, walk a bit faster for a minute or so. This could help improve your cardiovascular health. But remember, the most important thing is to listen to your body, and only increase your activity as tolerated. Could you see yourself incorporating this into your existing routine?",
        "our_model": "Wonderful, Mr. Gardner. One suggestion is to gradually increase the length of your walks. For example, you could aim to walk for 35 minutes next week and then 40 minutes the week after. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that sound doable to you?"
