    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great way to stay active, Mr. Gardner. How often do you go for walks and how long are they typically?\n\nPatient: Usually, every day for thirty minutes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Gardner. Walking daily for thirty minutes is a great routine. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations to help you continue to improve your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Mr. Gardner. One suggestion is to gradually increase the length of your walks. For example, you could aim to walk for 35 minutes next week and then 40 minutes the week after. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that sound doable to you?\n\nPatient: Yes. But how long should I walk for?\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Gardner. The goal is to gradually increase your walking time. For example, if you're currently walking for 30 minutes, you could aim to walk for 35 minutes next week and then 40 minutes the week after. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that sound manageable to you?\n\nPatient: So I shouldn't walk for more than forty minutes.",

        "gpt4": "Actually, Mr. Gardner, 40 minutes is not a strict limit, it's just an aim to start incrementally increasing your exercise time. As long as you're not feeling overly fatigued or experiencing any discomfort, you could continue to gradually increase your walking time. Always pay attention to how you feel during and after exercise. Does that make sense?",

If you're currently walking for 30 minutes, you could aim to walk for 35 minutes next week and then 40 minutes the week after. However, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that make sense?"
