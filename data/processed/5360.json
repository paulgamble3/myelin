    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great question, Mr. Gardner. The goal is to gradually increase your walking time. For example, if you're currently walking for 30 minutes, you could aim to walk for 35 minutes next week and then 40 minutes the week after. Remember, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that sound manageable to you?\n\nPatient: So I shouldn't walk for more than forty minutes.\n\nNurse: That's not exactly what I meant, Mr. Gardner. The goal is to gradually increase your walking time. If you're currently walking for 30 minutes, you could aim to walk for 35 minutes next week and then 40 minutes the week after. However, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm asking what's the longest amount that I should lock for?\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Gardner. The longest amount of time you should walk depends on how you're feeling. It's critical to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. If you feel comfortable, you can gradually increase your walking time. However, if you start to feel tired or short of breath, it's okay to slow down or take a break. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: I guess so. Whatever.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Gardner. It's essential to find a balance that works for you. Now, I want to acknowledge that adjusting diet and exercise can be challenging. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: No.",
