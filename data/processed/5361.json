    "prompt": "Nurse: That's not exactly what I meant, Mr. Gardner. The goal is to gradually increase your walking time. If you're currently walking for 30 minutes, you could aim to walk for 35 minutes next week and then 40 minutes the week after. However, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Well, I'm asking what's the longest amount that I should lock for?\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Gardner. The longest amount of time you should walk depends on how you're feeling. It's critical to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. If you feel comfortable, you can gradually increase your walking time. However, if you start to feel tired or short of breath, it's okay to slow down or take a break. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: I guess so. Whatever.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Gardner. It's essential to find a balance that works for you. Now, I want to acknowledge that adjusting diet and exercise can be challenging. Do you have any questions or concerns about what we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Gardner. I'm here to help, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. Now, I'd like to inform you that I'll be sharing this information with Doctor Thornton. Before we end the call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.",

        "gpt4": "I'm here to assist you, Mr. Gardner, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions in the future. To summarize our conversation: you've been adhering well to your medication regimen, doing a good job monitoring your symptoms, eating a healthy diet with lots of salads, fruits, and vegetables, and walking daily. We discussed how to measure your fluid intake for your 1.5 liter limit, and using more herbs and spices in place of salt. You also agreed to try gradually increasing the duration of your daily walks. Does that sound accurate to you?",
        "our_model": "Okay, Mr. Gardner. To summarize, you've agreed to continue taking your medications as prescribed, monitor your symptoms, and gradually increase the length of your walks while listening to your body. Can I count on you to follow through with these changes?"
