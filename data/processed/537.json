    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, let's move on to the next question. Have you noticed any signs of illness recently, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No, ma'am.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for the last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone available to pick you up, as you won't be able to drive yourself home after the procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the logistics of your procedure day?\n\nPatient: No. I do not.\n\nNurse: Alright, that was all the topics for today. Before we wrap up, do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Great! Here's a brief summary of our conversation today. We went through the importance of a low fiber diet a few days before your colonoscopy, moving to a clear liquid diet the day before. We also confirmed the details about your medications, talked about the GoLYTELY laxative solution, and the need to arrange for a ride home after your procedure. You understood and agreed to each step. Does that sound right to you?",
