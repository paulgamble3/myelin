        "gpt4": "I absolutely understand your concerns about stopping Aspirin, Mr. O'Leary. It's used to reduce your risk of heart attacks and strokes. However, it also thins your blood, which can lead to increased bleeding during surgery. That's why it's been recommended for you to stop it 7 days before your procedure. I can assure you that this instruction is routine before surgeries like yours. If you have any concerns about your stroke risk during this period, I strongly advise you to discuss it with your doctor. Can we proceed with other medication-related instructions?",
