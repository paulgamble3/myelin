Now, for the last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone available to pick you up, as you won't be able to drive yourself home after the procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the logistics of your procedure day?\n\nPatient: No. I do not.\n\nNurse: Alright, that was all the topics for today. Before we wrap up, do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, to summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00\n\nPatient: I have no questions, no concerns, I'm good to go.",
