    "prompt": "Patient: Well, just\n\nPatient: Just the one I just told you about. I am taking aspirin.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming that, Mr. O'Leary. It's critical to note that other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Oxycodone 5 mg as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great, Mr. O'Leary. Having these medications on hand will help manage your pain after the procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medications you're currently taking?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. Let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. O'Leary. It's important to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you'll need to take a shower as usual, and then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?",
        "our_model": "That's excellent, Mr. O'Leary. The chlorhexidine scrub is available at most pharmacies over the counter. Let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?"
