    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you, Mr. O'Leary. After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that?\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: Mr. O'Leary, are you still there?\n\nPatient: That.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. O'Leary, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: Oh my god. I said yes. I can do that.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming that, Mr. O'Leary. After applying the scrub, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No.",
