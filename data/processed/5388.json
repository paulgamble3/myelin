I said yes. I can do that.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming that, Mr. O'Leary. After applying the scrub, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
