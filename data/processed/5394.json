It's critical to manage your weight for your overall health, but it's also crucial to avoid any signs of illness before your procedure.

Do you have any other questions about your health or medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. Let's move on to the next topic. Your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure. Is that still correct?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming that, Mr. O'Leary.

If plans change and you're unable to secure a ride home, remember that you still have some time to figure it out, but you will indeed need someone on standby to pick you up when the hospital calls.
