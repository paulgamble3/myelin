    "prompt": "Nurse: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. O'Leary. It's critical to manage your weight for your overall health, but it's also crucial to avoid any signs of illness before your procedure. Lasix is a medication that helps manage fluid levels in your body, and it's not typically used for weight loss. Do you have any other questions about your health or medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. O'Leary. Let's move on to the next topic. Your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure. Is that still correct?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming that, Mr. O'Leary. It's important to have a safe and comfortable place to recover after your procedure. My last question is about your transportation and support after the procedure. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you afterwards?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. O'Leary. It's critical to have someone to assist you after the procedure. If there's anything else you need to arrange, you still have time to do so. Do you have any questions about your discharge plan or anything else?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "I appreciate your time today, Mr. O'Leary. I know we've covered a lot of ground. Based on our conversation, you are stopping Aspirin today. You've picked up your post-op medications, and you have purchased the chlorhexidine scrub. You are aware not to eat or drink after midnight before your procedure and have arranged for a ride home and help after the procedure. Can I count on you to follow through with all these tasks?",
