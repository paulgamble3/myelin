Before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, I wanted to ask if there are any symptoms or health concerns you've been experiencing lately that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I can't think of any.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Hardy. If you do have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, please feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Hardy. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Hardy. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: It was a one forty eight.",
