    "prompt": "Patient: Yeah. Well, I didn't get the results yet. Where are they?\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion, Mr. Hardy. I have the results here, but the best way to get the most accurate and up-to-date information would be to contact your doctor's office directly. They can provide you with the most recent results and explain them in detail. Is there a specific result you're curious about?\n\nPatient: It's all of them. I know they time you tested for lots of things that did.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Hardy, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: I just wanna know all of the results.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Hardy. Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 139 mEq/L, potassium level is 3.6 mEq/L, BUN level is 6.87 mmol/L, creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, GFR is 90 mL/min/1.73m2, and urine albumin level is 82 mg/g. These results are important for monitoring your kidney function and overall health. If you have any specific questions about these results, I'm here to help.\n\nPatient: Yeah. What's the GFR? You're in Alabama,\n\nPatient: me.",

        "our_model": "GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate, Mr. Hardy. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the glomeruli each minute. Glomeruli are the tiny filters in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. A GFR of 90 mL/min/1.73m2, like yours, is within the normal range, indicating your kidneys are functioning well. Does that help clarify things for you?"
