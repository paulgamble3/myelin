    "prompt": "Patient: It's all of them. I know they time you tested for lots of things that did.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Hardy, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: I just wanna know all of the results.\n\nNurse: I understand, Mr. Hardy. Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 139 mEq/L, potassium level is 3.6 mEq/L, BUN level is 6.87 mmol/L, creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, GFR is 90 mL/min/1.73m2, and urine albumin level is 82 mg/g. These results are important for monitoring your kidney function and overall health. If you have any specific questions about these results, I'm here to help.\n\nPatient: Yeah. What's the GFR? You're in Alabama,\n\nPatient: me.\n\nNurse: GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate, Mr. Hardy. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the glomeruli each minute. Glomeruli are the tiny filters in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. A GFR of 90 mL/min/1.73m2, like yours, is within the normal range, indicating your kidneys are functioning well. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. And what does urine and albin mom mean?",

        "gpt4": "Urine albumin, not albin mom, is a test that measures the amount of albumin in your urine. Albumin is a protein that's typically found in the blood, and healthy kidneys don't let albumin pass into the urine. A high level of albumin in the urine might mean kidney disease. Your urine albumin level is 82 mg/g, which is higher than normal. This is something you may want to discuss with your doctor. Would you like any more information on this topic?",
        "our_model": "Urine albumin is a test that measures the amount of albumin in your urine. Albumin is a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. A high level of albumin in the urine can be a sign of kidney disease. Your urine albumin level is 82 mg/g, which is a bit high. This is something your doctor will likely want to monitor closely. Does that answer your question, Mr. Hardy?"
