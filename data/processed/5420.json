    "prompt": "Nurse: GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate, Mr. Hardy. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the glomeruli each minute. Glomeruli are the tiny filters in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. A GFR of 90 mL/min/1.73m2, like yours, is within the normal range, indicating your kidneys are functioning well. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. And what does urine and albin mom mean?\n\nNurse: Urine albumin is a test that measures the amount of albumin in your urine. Albumin is a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. A high level of albumin in the urine can be a sign of kidney disease. Your urine albumin level is 82 mg/g, which is a bit high. This is something your doctor will likely want to monitor closely. Does that answer your question, Mr. Hardy?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Hardy. I'm glad I could help clarify those terms for you. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Lisinopril 5 mg daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Hardy. Taking your medication as prescribed is crucial for managing your conditions. Now, let's move on to the next medication. You're also prescribed Apixaban 5 mg, to be taken two times a day. Have you been taking this medication as directed?\n\nPatient: Uh-huh.",
