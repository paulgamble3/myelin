    "prompt": "Nurse: Urine albumin is a test that measures the amount of albumin in your urine. Albumin is a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. A high level of albumin in the urine can be a sign of kidney disease. Your urine albumin level is 82 mg/g, which is a bit high. This is something your doctor will likely want to monitor closely. Does that answer your question, Mr. Hardy?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Mr. Hardy. I'm glad I could help clarify those terms for you. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Lisinopril 5 mg daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Hardy. Taking your medication as prescribed is crucial for managing your conditions. Now, let's move on to the next medication. You're also prescribed Apixaban 5 mg, to be taken two times a day. Have you been taking this medication as directed?\n\nPatient: Uh-huh.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Hardy.
