It's completely normal to feel this way, especially when facing medical procedures as we age. Is there anything specific about the colonoscopy that's causing you concern?\n\nPatient: Well,\n\nNurse: Yes, I'm here to help. What's on your mind about the colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: to be honest, I've never had one before, and I can't believe that I'm at the age where I actually we need one.\n\nNurse: I see, I see, it's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed when facing a new medical procedure, especially one as significant as a colonoscopy. It's a preventative screening for colon cancer, and it's great that you're taking this step to take care of your health. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we go over the preparation for the procedure?\n\nPatient: I didn't hear you.",
