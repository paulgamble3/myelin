    "prompt": "Patient: Hello? Are you there?\n\nNurse: Yes, I'm here. I'm glad to hear that you're not currently having any questions about the procedure. If any questions come up during our conversation, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: I appreciate you letting me know. Give me a moment to check how I can best help you.",
