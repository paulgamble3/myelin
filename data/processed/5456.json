    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, thank you for letting me know. I'm here to help, so don't hesitate to reach out if any questions come up. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Yes. Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you, I appreciate your patience. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: I said I'm not.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion. I heard that you're not taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners. That's good to hear. Do you have any questions about medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: No.",

Avoid foods high in fiber such as whole grains, nuts, seeds, and some fruits and vegetables. Do you have questions regarding the low fiber diet?",
