    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize for the confusion. I heard that you're not taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners. That's good to hear. Do you have any questions about medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, thank you for letting me know. I'm here to help, so don't hesitate to reach out if any questions come up. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: I'm sorry. You said I can eat? Knox seeds,\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion. You should avoid foods like nuts and\n\nPatient: And fruits and vegetables, you cut out there.\n\nNurse: seeds because I apologize for the confusion. I meant to say that you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables while on a low fiber diet. These foods are high in fiber and can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any other questions about the diet?\n\nPatient: I should eat them or I shouldn't.",
