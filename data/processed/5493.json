I don't understand.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Ms. Aguirre. Your potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L is within the normal range. Potassium is a mineral that's crucial for heart function, muscle contraction, and nerve transmission. It's good that your level is within the normal range.

If it's okay with you, I'd like to go over a few topics to check on how you're doing. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: That's alright.\n\nNurse: Okay, thank\n\nPatient: Yes.",
