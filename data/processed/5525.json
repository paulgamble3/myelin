I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. Before we begin, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't have any questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. Please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. I'm here to help you prepare for your colonoscopy. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: No. It's fine.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves.

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss at this time?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr. Alves. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way.
