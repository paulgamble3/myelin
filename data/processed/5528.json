You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That sounds\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Alves. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming, Mr. Alves. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: I'm ready.",
