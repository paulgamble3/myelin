    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Alves. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming, Mr. Alves. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: I'm ready.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Alves. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications in preparation for your colonoscopy.\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "our_model": "Great, Mr. Alves. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications in preparation for your colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?"
