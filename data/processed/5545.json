I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution.\n\nPatient: You can move on.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves.

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Alves. It's good to hear that you're feeling okay about this next step. Just to clarify, you don't need to do anything just yet. You'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids, which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Do you mind if I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you may have about this?",
