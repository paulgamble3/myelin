    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution.\n\nPatient: You can move on.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: I'm okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay about it, Mr. Alves. It's true that most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't have any questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. Just to remind you, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Good.",
