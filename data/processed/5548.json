    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay about it, Mr. Alves. It's true that most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I don't have any questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. Just to remind you, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Alves. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Alves, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: I don't.",
