    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. Just to remind you, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Alves. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Alves, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the clear liquid diet. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: I don't.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad to hear that you're feeling confident about the clear liquid diet, Mr. Alves. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then, you'll need to wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?",
