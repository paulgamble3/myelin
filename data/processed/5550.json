Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Alves, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the clear liquid diet. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. Let's move on to the other main step to remember, which is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
