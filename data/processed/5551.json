    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Alves, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the clear liquid diet. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. Let's move on to the other main step to remember, which is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Alves. Here are a couple of tips that might make the bowel prep easier for you. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it easier to drink. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: Okay. I can do that.",
