    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Mr. Alves. Here are a couple of tips that might make the bowel prep easier for you. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it easier to drink. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: Okay. I can do that.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you find these tips helpful, Mr. Alves. Remember, the goal is to make this process as comfortable as possible for you. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. Let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. It's important to follow these instructions to ensure your colonoscopy goes smoothly. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your preparation?\n\nPatient: No. I can't.",
