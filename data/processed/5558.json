Could you please repeat what you said about your preparation for the colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: I don't have any questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on all the instructions so far. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have two more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I appreciate your patience. My first question is about your current health status. Have you been experiencing any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Alves. It's important to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Thank you. A friend of mine who's picking me up.",
