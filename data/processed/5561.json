It's critical to have someone available to take you home after the procedure. I'm glad you've arranged that. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your upcoming colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. That was all the topics for today. Before we end this call, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves.
