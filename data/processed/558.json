Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: Not really, to be honest. I'm I'm a very big routine person. So I do my best to just follow that routine. You know?\n\nNurse: That's fantastic. Sticking to a routine can be very helpful in managing medications. You're doing a great job. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Thank you. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.",
