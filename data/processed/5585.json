Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nPatient: Well, you're supposed to be talking to me about this colonoscopy that I have. I'm not sure what else you wanna help me with.\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. I apologize for the confusion earlier. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need. I will also call you again the day before your procedure. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is on August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 10:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
