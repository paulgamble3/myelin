    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, I'm here. I'm going to talk about your medications. Are you currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming that. You will need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great. Do you have any questions about stopping Xarelto?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.",
