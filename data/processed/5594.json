    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. Are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Let's smoothly transition to the diet prep for the colonoscopy. Starting today, you will want to eat a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice. You should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Great. What low fiber foods do you like to eat as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Pasta.",

        "gpt4": "Sounds good. That will work for your low fiber diet. The day before the procedure, on August 16, you will only have clear liquids. This includes foods like broth, apple juice, and jello in flavors other than red or purple. You will also take your bowel prep medicine, typically split into two doses. Does that make sense?",
        "our_model": "That's a great choice, pasta is indeed a comfort food for many. Do you have a favorite pasta dish you're planning to make?"
