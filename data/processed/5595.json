    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Let's smoothly transition to the diet prep for the colonoscopy. Starting today, you will want to eat a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice. You should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Great. What low fiber foods do you like to eat as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Pasta.\n\nNurse: That's a great choice, pasta is indeed a comfort food for many. Do you have a favorite pasta dish you're planning to make?\n\nPatient: I hadn't really thought about it. I mean, it's only one day.",

        "gpt4": "You're right, it is only one day, but if pasta is your comfort food, why not make something you love? You can make it as simple or elaborate as you want. Some butter and a little parmesan can go a long way! However, let's move on to day before the procedure. Have you done a colonoscopy before?",
        "our_model": "I see. It's a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. It's a small change, but it can make a big difference in your colonoscopy prep. Let's move on to the next topic. Are you currently taking any supplements like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications?"
