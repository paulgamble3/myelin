    "prompt": "Nurse: Great. What low fiber foods do you like to eat as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Pasta.\n\nNurse: That's a great choice, pasta is indeed a comfort food for many. Do you have a favorite pasta dish you're planning to make?\n\nPatient: I hadn't really thought about it. I mean, it's only one day.\n\nNurse: I see. It's a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. It's a small change, but it can make a big difference in your colonoscopy prep. Let's move on to the next topic. Are you currently taking any supplements like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. You will need to stop any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No. No.",
