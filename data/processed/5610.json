    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. The last part of your prep is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have 2 more questions for you. Before we move on, do you have any questions about anything we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. My next question is about your current health status. Do you have any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health for your procedure. My last question is about your transportation after the procedure. Have you arranged for a ride home after your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.",
