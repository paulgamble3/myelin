    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: So how can I slow the progression of CKD?\n\nNurse: I'm glad you're thinking about your health proactively. Would you like some general advice on how to slow the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease?\n\nPatient: What kind of lifestyle changes are recommended?\n\nNurse: I'm glad you're thinking about your overall health. Lifestyle changes can indeed help manage CKD. However, I'm an AI nurse and my primary focus is on your upcoming colonoscopy. I would recommend discussing this with your doctor or a dietitian who can provide personalized advice. They can guide you on dietary changes, physical activity, and other lifestyle modifications that can help manage CKD. Does that sound okay?\n\nPatient: I guess. Thanks, Rachel.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over your medication, diet changes, and bowel prep with the NuLYTELY laxative solution. You've confirmed that you've arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
