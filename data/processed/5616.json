    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad you're thinking about your health proactively. Would you like some general advice on how to slow the progression of Chronic Kidney Disease?\n\nPatient: What kind of lifestyle changes are recommended?\n\nNurse: I'm glad you're thinking about your overall health. Lifestyle changes can indeed help manage CKD. However, I'm an AI nurse and my primary focus is on your upcoming colonoscopy. I would recommend discussing this with your doctor or a dietitian who can provide personalized advice. They can guide you on dietary changes, physical activity, and other lifestyle modifications that can help manage CKD. Does that sound okay?\n\nPatient: I guess. Thanks, Rachel.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over your medication, diet changes, and bowel prep with the NuLYTELY laxative solution. You've confirmed that you've arranged for a ride home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. I want to remind you that I'm here for you every step of the way. I will call you again the day before the procedure to go over step by step all the prep instructions. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, you can call us back at 641-381-6523. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Sounds great.",
