    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, let's move on to your medications. I see that you don't have any new prescriptions, but I'd like to confirm that you're still taking your existing medications. Are you still taking Valsartan and Lasix?\n\nPatient: Yes. I am.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. And are you also continuing with your Methotrexate?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.\n\nNurse: Great, it's important to keep up with your medications. Are you taking them as prescribed, which would be Valsartan and Lasix twice a day, and Methotrexate once a week?\n\nPatient: That is correct.\n\nNurse: Excellent, you're doing a great job managing your medications. It's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No. I'm good at remembering.",
