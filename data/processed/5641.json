    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good news. Have you noticed any increased swelling in your feet, ankles, stomach, or legs?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep an eye on these symptoms at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be a bit complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No. I think I understand. Just go down the list",

        "gpt4": "Yes, exactly. Go down the list and check off each symptom as you perform your daily self-check. It's really helpful in tracking any changes in your health.
