        "gpt4": "It's wonderful that you're open to learning more. Since you're managing CHF and CKD, following a cardiac and renal diet is recommended. This means a focus on lean proteins, reduced sodium, controlled potassium, and limiting fluids. For your lupus, a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein can be beneficial. Does that help?",
        "our_model": "Great. For your cardiac and renal diet, it's recommended to limit your intake of sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. This means avoiding processed foods and choosing fresh fruits and vegetables instead. It's also important to limit your fluid intake. For your Lupus, a balanced diet is key. This includes a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. It's also important to limit your intake of sugars and alcohol. Does this information help?"
