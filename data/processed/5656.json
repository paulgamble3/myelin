        "gpt4": "That's great. To start, it's important to do exercises at a pace that you feel comfortable with. In terms of types of exercises, the ones you're doing such as walking, biking and pickle ball are excellent. But, I would also recommend adding some light strength training, if possible. This can help improve your muscle strength and overall health. Always remember to warm up before starting and cool down after finishing your exercises. Also, keep yourself hydrated. Does this make sense?",
        "our_model": "Excellent. It's important to listen to your body while exercising. If you feel short of breath or fatigued, it's okay to slow down or take a break. Also, consider incorporating some light strength training exercises into your routine, as they can help improve your overall strength and endurance. Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with your doctor before starting any new exercise routine. Does this sound manageable to you?"
