I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Maria Rodriguez. I hope you're feeling better now that you're home from the hospital. How are you doing today?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I'm feeling pretty good. Everything's going pretty nicely.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It must be a relief to be back in your own home. Is there anything in particular you've been looking forward to doing now that you're home?\n\nPatient: I'm just happy to sleep in my own bed.\n\nNurse: That sounds wonderful, there's nothing quite like the comfort of your own bed. Do you have any hobbies or interests that you've missed while you were in the hospital?\n\nPatient: I'm happy to start embroidering again.",
