    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. It's critical to take your medications as prescribed to manage your CHF. Now, I understand that sometimes it can be challenging to remember to take medications on time. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, with your permission, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Go for it.\n\nNurse: Thank you. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your response?\n\nPatient: No.",
