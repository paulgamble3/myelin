        "gpt4": "As per Doctor Rodriguez's notes, you are currently following a cardiac diet. This type of diet emphasizes fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains while limiting sodium, saturated fats, and cholesterol. In addition to this, due to your Fanconi-Bickel disease, it's also important to restrict your intake of fructose and galactose. As for supplements, that would be something to discuss with your doctor directly, as they would have a better understanding of your specific needs. \n\nCould I provide you with some more information on these dietary restrictions to help you maintain a balanced diet?",
