    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep track of these symptoms at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be a bit complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: I actually have a question about my diet. What dietary\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: restrictions and supplements do I need?\n\nNurse: That's a great question. As someone with CHF, you're following a cardiac diet. This means eating a variety of nutrient-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. It also means limiting sodium, added sugars, and unhealthy fats. In addition, due to your Fanconi-Bickel disease, you're also restricting Fructose and Galactose. Would you like me to share some specific dietary recommendations?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you for giving me the opportunity to provide some guidance. Let's start with the cardiac diet. One of the key things to remember is to limit the sodium in your diet. You can do this by avoiding processed foods, using herbs and spices for flavoring instead of salt, and choosing low-sodium options when available. \n\nWhen it comes to your fructose and galactose restriction, you should avoid foods containing these substances. Fructose is mainly found in fruits, honey, and high-fructose corn syrup. Galactose is mainly found in milk and dairy products.\n\nIt's always important to read food labels carefully and consult with your doctor or a dietician if you're unsure. Does everything make sense so far?",
        "our_model": "Great. For your cardiac diet, it's important to include a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins like chicken or fish, whole grains, and healthy fats like avocados or olive oil. You should limit sodium, added sugars, and unhealthy fats. For your Fanconi-Bickel disease, it's crucial to avoid foods high in fructose and galactose. This includes fruits like apples and pears, and foods made with high fructose corn syrup. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?"
