    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. Now, based on what you've shared about your recent meals, it seems like you're doing a good job following your dietary recommendations. Remember, it's important to keep doing so for your health. Do you have any concerns or questions about maintaining this diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Now, let's talk about exercise. Could you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: I go for a walk a few times a week.\n\nNurse: That's a great start. Walking is a wonderful low-impact exercise that can help manage CHF. How long do your walks usually last?\n\nPatient: Forty five minutes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. A 45-minute walk is a good way to stay active. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great. It's beneficial to keep your exercise consistent. Aim for forty-five minutes, three times a week. Remember, it's important to not push yourself too hard. If you ever feel out of breath or tired, it's okay to take a break. Also, always check with your doctor before starting a new exercise routine. Can you commit to maintaining and improving your current exercise routine?",
        "our_model": "Okay. It's critical to remember to listen to your body while exercising. If you feel short of breath or fatigued, it's okay to slow down or take a break. You might also consider adding some light strength training exercises to your routine, such as lifting small hand weights or using resistance bands. However, it's always best to consult with your doctor before starting any new exercise program. Does that sound manageable to you?"
