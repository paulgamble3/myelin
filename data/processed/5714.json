    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Ms. Aguirre. If you do have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, please feel free to bring them up. Would it be alright if we go over a few topics related to your health now?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent, thank you, Ms. Aguirre. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: One twenty eight.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Aguirre. A blood sugar level of 128 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "That's great, Ms. Aguirre. Here are some tips that might help:\n\n1. Aim to eat regularly: Try to have 3 meals per day at regular times. This can help your body better use the insulin it produces or gets through medication.\n\n2. Control portion sizes: A dietitian can help you learn how many servings of different types of foods you should eat each meal.\n\n3. Get more physical activity: Regular exercise can help prevent prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and it can help those who already have diabetes to maintain better blood sugar control.\n\n4. Take your medications as directed: If you're taking medication, it's important to follow your doctor's recommendations closely.\n\nDo you have any queries or concerns about these recommendations?",
        "our_model": "I apologize for the confusion earlier, Ms. Aguirre. You mentioned that your last blood sugar reading was 128. Just to confirm, is this reading higher or lower than your usual readings?"
