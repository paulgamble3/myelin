    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: One twenty eight.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Aguirre. A blood sugar level of 128 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Ms. Aguirre. You mentioned that your last blood sugar reading was 128. Just to confirm, is this reading higher or lower than your usual readings?\n\nPatient: I guess it's\n\nNurse: Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you. Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nPatient: Like, my normal reading?",
