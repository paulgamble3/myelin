These foods are generally lower in sodium. \n\n2. Be aware of hidden sodium: Sodium can be found in surprising places, even in sweets. Always check the Nutrition Facts label.\n\n3. Monitor fluid intake: Instead of chugging large amounts at once, sip on fluids throughout the day.\n\n4. If permitted, use herbs and spices to flavor your food: Instead of adding extra salt, try using herbs, spices, and low-sodium alternatives. \n\nDo you have any questions on dietary recommendations or restrictions?",
        "our_model": "Excellent. When it comes to sodium, it's not just about adding salt to your food. Many processed foods, like canned soups or frozen meals, can be high in sodium. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label. Also, try to limit your intake of high-sodium snacks like chips or pretzels. As for fluid intake, it's important to remember that this includes all fluids, not just water. This includes coffee, tea, and soups. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?"
