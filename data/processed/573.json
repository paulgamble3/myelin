Popcorn is a whole grain and nuts are a healthy source of fat. Now, I'd like to remind you of your dietary recommendations. Your sodium intake is not to exceed 2000 mg per day. Fluid intake is not to exceed 1.5 to 2 Liters per day. Can I share some dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Sure. Yeah.\n\nNurse: Excellent. When it comes to sodium, it's not just about adding salt to your food. Many processed foods, like canned soups or frozen meals, can be high in sodium. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label. Also, try to limit your intake of high-sodium snacks like chips or pretzels. As for fluid intake, it's important to remember that this includes all fluids, not just water. This includes coffee, tea, and soups. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think I do.",

        "gpt4": "That's great! It's a pleasure to hear you're managing well. Let's review when it's necessary to contact your medical provider. You should reach out if you have increased swelling in the legs, feet, or belly, sudden weight increase (like gaining 2-3 pounds overnight or 5 pounds in one week), difficulty breathing, frequent cough, or feeling more tired than usual. Other triggers can be fainting, rapid heartbeat, or just not feeling right. Does this sound reasonable to you?",
        "our_model": "Alright. Now, based on what you've told me about your diet, it seems like you're doing a great job. Just remember to keep an eye on sodium levels in processed foods and your fluid intake. Now, let's talk about exercise. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?"
