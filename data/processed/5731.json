    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great question, Ms. Aguirre. Sodium and potassium are both types of electrolytes, which are minerals in your body that have an electric charge. They are necessary for your body to function properly, including your heart, muscles, and nerves. Your sodium level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Sodium helps control your body's fluid balance and also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Your potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, which is also within the normal range. Potassium helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, to function properly. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. So does that mean I'll need to get dialysis?\n\nNurse: Your lab results show that your kidney function is at a level where dialysis might be considered. However, the decision to start dialysis is based on many factors, including how you're feeling and your overall health. Your doctor, Doctor Contreras, will discuss this with you based on your specific situation. Would you like me to note down that you're concerned about this for your care team to review?\n\nPatient: Yes, please.\n\nNurse: I've made a note of your concern, Ms. Aguirre. Your care team will discuss this with you. Now, let's move on to your medications. You're currently taking Metformin 500 mg once a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Aguirre. Regularly taking your medication as prescribed is crucial for managing your conditions. Now, let's discuss the next medication. You're also prescribed Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as directed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "That's excellent, Ms. Aguirre. Just as a reminder, Tylenol is used to relieve pain, like the type you might experience due to your back surgeries. It's important not to exceed the dose your doctor has prescribed, to avoid any potential harm to your kidneys. Let's move on to your next medication - Atorvastatin 40 mg, to be taken once daily. Have you been taking it as directed?",
