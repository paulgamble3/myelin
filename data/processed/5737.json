    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Ms. Aguirre, there are certain medications that can contribute to kidney damage. These include some pain medications like ibuprofen and naproxen, some antibiotics, and certain medications used to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. It's always important to use these medications as directed by your doctor and to have your kidney function monitored regularly if you're taking them. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Okay. So none of my meds are the type that will injure my kidneys.\n\nNurse: Based on the medications you've mentioned - Metformin, Tylenol, and Atorvastatin - none of these are known to cause kidney damage. However, it's always important to take them as prescribed by your doctor. If you have any concerns about your medications, it's best to discuss them with Doctor Contreras. Does that help alleviate your concern?\n\nPatient: Yes. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Ms. Aguirre. I'm glad I could help. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I was gonna ask you about that.\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please share\n\nPatient: I'm supposed to be on a Reno low carb, low salt",
