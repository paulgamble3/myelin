    "prompt": "Nurse: Based on the medications you've mentioned - Metformin, Tylenol, and Atorvastatin - none of these are known to cause kidney damage. However, it's always important to take them as prescribed by your doctor. If you have any concerns about your medications, it's best to discuss them with Doctor Contreras. Does that help alleviate your concern?\n\nPatient: Yes. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Ms. Aguirre. I'm glad I could help. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I was gonna ask you about that.\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please share\n\nPatient: I'm supposed to be on a Reno low carb, low salt\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Aguirre, your voice cut out a bit there. Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: diet. What food should I be eating considering I'm stage four CKD patient?",

        "gpt4": "That's a great question, Ms. Aguirre. As a patient with Stage IV CKD, your diet is indeed crucial in managing your health. \n\nIn a renal diet, you would want to focus on foods that are lower in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. This may include lean proteins such as chicken or fish, fruits and vegetables, and foods high in fiber like whole grains. Avoid processed foods as they tend to be high in sodium and unhealthy fats. \n\nFurthermore, a carbohydrate-controlled diet of 130 grams per day is recommended for your type II diabetes. \n\nI would also suggest limiting your sodium intake to less than 2300 mg per day. This can help manage your blood pressure.\n\nDo these recommendations help guide you in your meal planning, Ms. Aguirre?",
