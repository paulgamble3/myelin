        "gpt4": "Thanks for sharing your concern, Ms. Aguirre. For stage 4 chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), a low potassium, low phosphorus, and low salt diet is usually recommended. It's important to talk to a dietitian who specializes in kidney disease to get diet recommendations tailored to your needs. However, as a general guide:\n\n1. Low Potassium Foods: Apples, cranberries, grapes, pineapples, strawberries, bell peppers, cabbage, green beans, and onion. \n\n2. Low Phosphorus Foods: Fresh fruits and vegetables, rice, pasta, corn and peas, light-coloured sodas, and popcorn.\n\n3. Low Salt Foods: Avoid processed foods as they tend to be high in sodium. You can use spices, herbs, and vinegar to flavour your food instead of salt. \n\nIncluding high-quality protein foods like fish, poultry, and lean meat can also be beneficial. Would you like more information on this?",
        "our_model": "I appreciate your question, Ms. Aguirre. As a Stage IV CKD patient, it's important to follow a diet that's low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. This means avoiding processed foods, certain fruits and vegetables, and dairy products. Instead, you should focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. For example, a balanced meal could include grilled chicken, steamed broccoli, and brown rice. Would you like more specific suggestions or do you have any other questions about your diet?"
