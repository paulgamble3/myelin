    "prompt": "Nurse: Those are good choices. Popcorn is a whole grain and nuts are a healthy source of fat. Now, I'd like to remind you of your dietary recommendations. Your sodium intake is not to exceed 2000 mg per day. Fluid intake is not to exceed 1.5 to 2 Liters per day. Can I share some dietary recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Sure. Yeah.\n\nNurse: Excellent. When it comes to sodium, it's not just about adding salt to your food. Many processed foods, like canned soups or frozen meals, can be high in sodium. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label. Also, try to limit your intake of high-sodium snacks like chips or pretzels. As for fluid intake, it's important to remember that this includes all fluids, not just water. This includes coffee, tea, and soups. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think I do.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, based on what you've told me about your diet, it seems like you're doing a great job. Just remember to keep an eye on sodium levels in processed foods and your fluid intake. Now, let's talk about exercise. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: Well, I don't really exercise too much, but I like to go on maybe a thirty minute walk of two or three times a week, that kind of is bank.\n\nPatient: And\n\nPatient: Yeah. I guess that's kinda my name. Stores. Of exercise.",
