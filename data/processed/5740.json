    "prompt": "Patient: Yeah. I was gonna ask you about that.\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please share\n\nPatient: I'm supposed to be on a Reno low carb, low salt\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Aguirre, your voice cut out a bit there. Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: diet. What food should I be eating considering I'm stage four CKD patient?\n\nNurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your question, Ms. Aguirre. As a Stage IV CKD patient, it's important to follow a diet that's low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. This means avoiding processed foods, certain fruits and vegetables, and dairy products. Instead, you should focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. For example, a balanced meal could include grilled chicken, steamed broccoli, and brown rice. Would you like more specific suggestions or do you have any other questions about your diet?\n\nPatient: No. That helps. Thank you.",
