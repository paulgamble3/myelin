    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent. When it comes to sodium, it's not just about adding salt to your food. Many processed foods, like canned soups or frozen meals, can be high in sodium. It's always a good idea to check the nutrition label. Also, try to limit your intake of high-sodium snacks like chips or pretzels. As for fluid intake, it's important to remember that this includes all fluids, not just water. This includes coffee, tea, and soups. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think I do.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, based on what you've told me about your diet, it seems like you're doing a great job. Just remember to keep an eye on sodium levels in processed foods and your fluid intake. Now, let's talk about exercise. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: Well, I don't really exercise too much, but I like to go on maybe a thirty minute walk of two or three times a week, that kind of is bank.\n\nPatient: And\n\nPatient: Yeah. I guess that's kinda my name. Stores. Of exercise.\n\nNurse: That's a great start. Walking is a wonderful low-impact exercise that can help manage CHF. How about other activities?\n\nPatient: I I don't know that I really do much else for exercises if I'm on it.",
