        "gpt4": "Alright, Ms. Aguirre. Just to summarize our conversation today - you shared that your recent blood sugar reading was slightly on the higher side, and you agreed to maintain your balanced diet and regular physical activity to manage it. You also acknowledged your slightly high blood pressure reading and confirmed your adherence to a low-salt diet. You expressed concern about potentially needing dialysis and I've noted this for your care team to review. You confirmed that you take your prescribed medications regularly. You also shared about your dietary habits, your successful recovery from back surgery, and your current smoking habits. I'm relying on you to keep up the good work with your diet and activity and to continue taking your medications as prescribed. Can I count on you to do these things?",
