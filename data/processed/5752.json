Can you share with me why you feel you're not ready to quit smoking?\n\nPatient: I don't really have a reason. I'm just not interested right now.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Aguirre. It's completely okay to feel this way. If you ever change your mind, I have a lot of resources that could help you. Would you like me to share these with you for future reference?\n\nPatient: No. Thanks.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Aguirre. If you ever decide you're interested in quitting, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm here to support you. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Aguirre. Just to summarize, you've agreed to continue monitoring your blood sugar and blood pressure, maintain a balanced diet, and stay active. You've also agreed to take your medications as prescribed and to discuss any concerns about your medications with your doctor. Can I count on you to continue these practices?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
