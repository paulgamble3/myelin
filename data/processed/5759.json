    "prompt": "Patient: Oh, I can't complain.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. It's essential to keep a positive outlook. As we move forward, I'd like to know how you're feeling about your upcoming colonoscopy procedure.\n\nPatient: Oh, well, you know. I'm not looking forward to it. But\n\nPatient: it's good to get it done.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, it's a significant step towards maintaining your health. It's completely normal to have some apprehension. Do you have any specific concerns or questions you'd like to discuss before we proceed?\n\nPatient: I don't know. Oh, I know. I was wondering how long the procedure takes.\n\nNurse: That's a great question. The actual colonoscopy procedure usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. However, you should plan on being at the hospital for 2 to 3 hours for the preparation, waiting, recovery, and observation. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Uh-huh.",
