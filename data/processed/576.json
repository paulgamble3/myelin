    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. Now, based on what you've told me about your diet, it seems like you're doing a great job. Just remember to keep an eye on sodium levels in processed foods and your fluid intake. Now, let's talk about exercise. Can you tell me about your current exercise routine?\n\nPatient: Well, I don't really exercise too much, but I like to go on maybe a thirty minute walk of two or three times a week, that kind of is bank.\n\nPatient: And\n\nPatient: Yeah. I guess that's kinda my name. Stores. Of exercise.\n\nNurse: That's a great start. Walking is a wonderful low-impact exercise that can help manage CHF. How about other activities?\n\nPatient: I I don't know that I really do much else for exercises if I'm on it.\n\nNurse: That's okay. Walking is a great form of exercise. If it's alright with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Would that be okay?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great. Incorporating regular physical activity into your routine can be very beneficial. If you're already walking, maybe start by gradually increasing your walking time. Aim for an additional 5 minutes each week until you reach a 45-minute walk, if possible. Please remember to take it at your own pace and rest if you need to. Another option might be to introduce some light strength exercises, like using small hand weights or resistance bands, but do check with your doctor before starting any new exercises. Do you think these suggestions might work for you?",
        "our_model": "Excellent. It's critical to remember that any increase in physical activity should be gradual. If you're comfortable with your current walking routine, you might consider adding an extra day or two of walking to your schedule. Also, consider adding some light strength training exercises to your routine. This could be something as simple as lifting a can of soup in each hand. Remember, it's always important to listen to your body and rest if you need to. Does that sound manageable to you?"
