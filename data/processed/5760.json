    "prompt": "Patient: Oh, well, you know. I'm not looking forward to it. But\n\nPatient: it's good to get it done.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, it's a significant step towards maintaining your health. It's completely normal to have some apprehension. Do you have any specific concerns or questions you'd like to discuss before we proceed?\n\nPatient: I don't know. Oh, I know. I was wondering how long the procedure takes.\n\nNurse: That's a great question. The actual colonoscopy procedure usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. However, you should plan on being at the hospital for 2 to 3 hours for the preparation, waiting, recovery, and observation. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Uh-huh.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could provide some clarity. It's important to us that you feel informed and comfortable. If you have any other questions at any point, please feel free to ask. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy now?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great, thank you. The process will involve a bowel prep. You'll receive instructions about a special diet to follow for a few days before the procedure. This diet will be low in fiber and will include lots of clear liquids. Then, the day before the procedure, you'll need to consume a liquid that will help cleanse your colon.\n\nIt's very important to follow these instructions carefully, as an improperly prepped colon may necessitate a repeat examination. This might sound a bit cumbersome, but it'll all be worth it to ensure a thorough and successful procedure.\n\nDo you have any questions about the prep process?",
        "our_model": "Great, thank you. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll also have another call the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our list. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions leading up to your colonoscopy?"
