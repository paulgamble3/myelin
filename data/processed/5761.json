    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely, it's a significant step towards maintaining your health. It's completely normal to have some apprehension. Do you have any specific concerns or questions you'd like to discuss before we proceed?\n\nPatient: I don't know. Oh, I know. I was wondering how long the procedure takes.\n\nNurse: That's a great question. The actual colonoscopy procedure usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. However, you should plan on being at the hospital for 2 to 3 hours for the preparation, waiting, recovery, and observation. Does that help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Uh-huh.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could provide some clarity. It's important to us that you feel informed and comfortable. If you have any other questions at any point, please feel free to ask. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy now?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll also have another call the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our list. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions leading up to your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: I think so. But if you wanna review those, that's fine with me.",

        "gpt4": "Of course, it never hurts to refresh our memories. The day before your colonoscopy, you'll need to stick to a clear liquid diet. That includes things like broths, clear juices, tea, or clear jello. You should avoid any colored drinks, milk or solids. Would you like me to list a few more examples of okay items to consume?",
        "our_model": "Absolutely, I'd be happy to review them. You'll need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before your procedure. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello, but avoid anything red or purple. You'll also need to take a bowel prep medication, which will help clean out your colon. It's critical to follow the instructions for this medication closely. Does that sound good to you?"
