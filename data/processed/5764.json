    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, thank you. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll also have another call the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our list. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions leading up to your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: I think so. But if you wanna review those, that's fine with me.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, I'd be happy to review them. You'll need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before your procedure. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello, but avoid anything red or purple. You'll also need to take a bowel prep medication, which will help clean out your colon. It's critical to follow the instructions for this medication closely. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That works.",
