Is there anything else about the logistics that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move forward. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. There is no need to stop this medication before your colonoscopy. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I just take Tylenol,",
