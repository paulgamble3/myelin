    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move forward. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. There is no need to stop this medication before your colonoscopy. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I just take Tylenol,\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming that. It's important to avoid certain medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about your medications?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This includes foods like white bread, rice, and pasta, and you should avoid high fiber foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: Nope. I don't think so.",

        "gpt4": "That's good to hear. It's okay to consume dairy products, eggs, and soft, canned, or well-cooked fruits and vegetables without skin during this period. While it might feel strange, this is one of the few times when doctors actually want you to be eating low fiber comfort foods!\n\nSpeaking of comfort foods, do you have any favorite low fiber foods? Perhaps something that you find enjoyable and comforting.",
        "our_model": "Great, it sounds like you've got a good understanding of the dietary changes. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy?"
