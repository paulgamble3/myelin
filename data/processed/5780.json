    "prompt": "Patient: Nope. I am not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to avoid those supplements and medications to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Well, like I said, I'm not looking forward to it, but\n\nPatient: I guess I've gotta do it. If they wanna get a good picture of my colon,\n\nNurse: Absolutely. It's a crucial part of the process to ensure we get the best possible results. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the process?\n\nPatient: Nope.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad to hear that. Your positive attitude will definitely help. Just to remind you, you don't have to do anything just yet, but you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involve no solid foods and drinking either clear or light-colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Is it alright if I share some examples of clear liquids that you can have?",
