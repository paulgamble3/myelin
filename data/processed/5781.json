    "prompt": "Patient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Well, like I said, I'm not looking forward to it, but\n\nPatient: I guess I've gotta do it. If they wanna get a good picture of my colon,\n\nNurse: Absolutely. It's a crucial part of the process to ensure we get the best possible results. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the process?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great, thank you. Clear liquids are liquids that you can see through. These include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello (but avoid red or purple). Also, you can have clear juices such as apple or white cranberry juice. Do you have any questions about these examples, or is there anything else you'd like to ask about the clear liquid diet?",
        "our_model": "Great. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's essential to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about the diet changes?"
