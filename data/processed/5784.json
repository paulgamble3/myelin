    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, if you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's essential to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: Know?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: No. I just said, no. I do not.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "The GoLYTELY solution can be chilled before drinking, which tends to make it taste better. Drinking it through a straw can also help. In addition, you can take a 15-30 minute break every time you feel full. Just make sure you finish the entire solution. The goal is to have clear liquid bowel movements indicating that your colon is clean for the procedure. Do you have any questions about this part?",
