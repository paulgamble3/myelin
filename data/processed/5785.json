    "prompt": "Nurse: Great. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's essential to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about the diet changes?\n\nPatient: Know?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: No. I just said, no. I do not.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Okay. One tip is to drink the laxative solution cold. This can make it easier to consume. Another tip is to drink the solution through a straw. This can help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips?\n\nPatient: Oh, that sounds like a good idea.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad you found them helpful! Just remember, the better you prepare, the easier the procedure will be for you and your doctor. The goal is a clear colon so that nothing is missed during your colonoscopy. Same-day cancellations due to incomplete prep can be inconvenient for everyone, so doing a good job with the prep is really important. Would you like to discuss any other aspects of your upcoming colonoscopy?",
