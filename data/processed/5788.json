Do you have any questions about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: I said, no. I no. I said no. I do not have questions.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask.
