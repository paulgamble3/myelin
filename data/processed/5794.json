    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's essential that you're in good health for your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone available to take you home after the procedure. Do you have any questions about the logistics of the day of your procedure?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. And you gotta stop asking me if I have any more questions. You've asked me, like, thirty times in the last three minutes\n\nNurse: I apologize if it felt repetitive. I just want to ensure all your questions are answered. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over your medication, the low fiber diet, the clear liquid diet, the bowel prep, and the need for a ride home after the procedure. You've agreed to follow these instructions. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Well, it it sounds very repetitive.",
