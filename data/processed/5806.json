    "prompt": "Nurse: I can imagine that the preparation process can be a bit uncomfortable.\n\nPatient: I'm glad I can get it done to rule out some things.\n\nNurse: I can imagine that the preparation process can be a bit uncomfortable. It's really commendable that you're taking this step for your health. Do you have any specific questions or concerns about the procedure that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: How long does the procedure take?\n\nNurse: The colonoscopy procedure itself typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes. However, you should plan to be at the hospital for 2 to 3 hours for the preparation, the procedure, and the recovery time. Is there anything else you'd like to know?\n\nPatient: Not right now.\n\nNurse: Alright. If you have any questions at any point during our conversation, feel free to ask. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy as a preventative screening for colon cancer. It can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Well, you already asked me that. And I said I'm not looking forward to it, but I'm grateful that I can get it done.",
