    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, what would you like to know?\n\nPatient: Can have stir fry? Or not?\n\nNurse: A stir-fry can be a part of your low-fiber diet, but it's important to be mindful of the ingredients. You should avoid high-fiber vegetables like broccoli, peppers, and leafy greens. Instead, you can include low-fiber vegetables like well-cooked carrots or green beans. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Yes. Do Brussels sprouts have lots of fiber?\n\nNurse: Yes, Brussels sprouts are high in fiber and should be avoided in the days leading up to your colonoscopy. Instead, you can opt for low-fiber vegetables like well-cooked carrots or green beans. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Sure. That makes sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Yogurt.",
