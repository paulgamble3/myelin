    "prompt": "Nurse: A stir-fry can be a part of your low-fiber diet, but it's important to be mindful of the ingredients. You should avoid high-fiber vegetables like broccoli, peppers, and leafy greens. Instead, you can include low-fiber vegetables like well-cooked carrots or green beans. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Yes. Do Brussels sprouts have lots of fiber?\n\nNurse: Yes, Brussels sprouts are high in fiber and should be avoided in the days leading up to your colonoscopy. Instead, you can opt for low-fiber vegetables like well-cooked carrots or green beans. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Sure. That makes sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Yogurt.\n\nNurse: Yogurt can be a good choice, especially if it's low in sugar. Just make sure to avoid any added fiber supplements. Do you usually have any particular type of yogurt or any specific way you enjoy it?\n\nPatient: I like to mix fruit with it.",

        "gpt4": "That certainly sounds delicious. However, for your upcoming colonoscopy, it's best to leave out the fruit and have the yogurt by itself or with a bit of honey. Eating low-fiber comfort food is one of the rare times when doctors want their patients to avoid whole fruits and vegetables. Do you have any other questions about diet and food preparation leading up to the colonoscopy?",
        "our_model": "That sounds delicious. However, for the preparation of your colonoscopy, it's best to avoid high-fiber fruits. You can still enjoy yogurt, but perhaps with a low-fiber topping like well-cooked carrots or green beans. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're wondering about?"
