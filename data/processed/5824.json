    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Brussels sprouts are high in fiber and should be avoided in the days leading up to your colonoscopy. Instead, you can opt for low-fiber vegetables like well-cooked carrots or green beans. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Sure. That makes sense.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food?\n\nPatient: Yogurt.\n\nNurse: Yogurt can be a good choice, especially if it's low in sugar. Just make sure to avoid any added fiber supplements. Do you usually have any particular type of yogurt or any specific way you enjoy it?\n\nPatient: I like to mix fruit with it.\n\nNurse: That sounds delicious. However, for the preparation of your colonoscopy, it's best to avoid high-fiber fruits. You can still enjoy yogurt, but perhaps with a low-fiber topping like well-cooked carrots or green beans. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're wondering about?\n\nPatient: Right. I get it. I'm not supposed to have fruit really because it has fiber.",

        "gpt4": "I appreciate your understanding, patient. It's good to hear that you have a clear idea about your diet leading up to the colonoscopy. Let's move on to discuss supplements. You'll need to stop taking any fiber supplements or anti-diarrheal medications you might have. Are there any that we should be aware of?",
        "our_model": "Yes, that's correct. During this preparation period, it's best to avoid high-fiber foods like fruits. However, this is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. So, enjoy your yogurt as it is. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're wondering about?"
