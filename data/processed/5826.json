    "prompt": "Nurse: Yogurt can be a good choice, especially if it's low in sugar. Just make sure to avoid any added fiber supplements. Do you usually have any particular type of yogurt or any specific way you enjoy it?\n\nPatient: I like to mix fruit with it.\n\nNurse: That sounds delicious. However, for the preparation of your colonoscopy, it's best to avoid high-fiber fruits. You can still enjoy yogurt, but perhaps with a low-fiber topping like well-cooked carrots or green beans. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're wondering about?\n\nPatient: Right. I get it. I'm not supposed to have fruit really because it has fiber.\n\nNurse: Yes, that's correct. During this preparation period, it's best to avoid high-fiber foods like fruits. However, this is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. So, enjoy your yogurt as it is. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're wondering about?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright. Let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.",
