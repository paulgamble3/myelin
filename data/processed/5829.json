    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. Let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to avoid those supplements and medications before a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Thanks.\n\nNurse: Of course. How are you feeling about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Not looking forward to this at all. I'm grateful I can have the procedure.",
