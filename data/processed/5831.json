    "prompt": "Nurse: You're welcome. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Thanks.\n\nNurse: Of course. How are you feeling about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Not looking forward to this at all. I'm grateful I can have the procedure.\n\nNurse: I can understand that it's not something to look forward to, but it's really commendable that you're taking this step for your health. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: I can imagine that it's not something you're looking forward to. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. But remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.",

        "gpt4": "That's alright. Please remember, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking clear or light-colored beverages. It's important to not consume any red or purple dye. Would you like for me to share some examples of what clear liquids are?",
