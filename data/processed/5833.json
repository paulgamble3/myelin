    "prompt": "Nurse: I can understand that it's not something to look forward to, but it's really commendable that you're taking this step for your health. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: I can imagine that it's not something you're looking forward to. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. But remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. Just to remind you, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: No. I already have a good understanding of that. So you could move along.\n\nNurse: Of course, let's move on. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.",

        "gpt4": "Alright. Like I mentioned earlier, you'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM the day before your procedure. Then, you'll wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. It's normal to have frequent loose stools or diarrhea after taking the PLENVU laxative. This means it's working to clean out your colon. Do you have any questions about this part of the process?",
        "our_model": "Alright. If you change your mind or have any questions about the bowel prep, don't hesitate to ask. Some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine."
