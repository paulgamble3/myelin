    "prompt": "Nurse: I can imagine that it's not something you're looking forward to. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. But remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. Just to remind you, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: No. I already have a good understanding of that. So you could move along.\n\nNurse: Of course, let's move on. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. If you change your mind or have any questions about the bowel prep, don't hesitate to ask. Some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine.\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE] Alright. Do you have anything else?",

        "gpt4": "We're almost done here. The last part of your prep is noting when you need to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Are you clear about this?",
        "our_model": "Yes, there's one more part of the preparation I'd like to discuss. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. This means no eating or drinking anything, including water, 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?"
