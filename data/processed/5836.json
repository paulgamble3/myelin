    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, let's move on. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright. If you change your mind or have any questions about the bowel prep, don't hesitate to ask. Some people don't have any problems and are able to drink all the bowel prep just fine.\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE] Alright. Do you have anything else?\n\nNurse: Yes, there's one more part of the preparation I'd like to discuss. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. This means no eating or drinking anything, including water, 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright. I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have 2 more questions for you. Before we move on, do you have any questions about anything we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: Hi. No. And you've asked me if I have any questions about ten times through this conversation. If I had a question, I would have asked it. So please stop asking me that question over and over again.",
