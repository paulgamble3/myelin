    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have 2 more questions for you. Before we move on, do you have any questions about anything we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: Hi. No. And you've asked me if I have any questions about ten times through this conversation. If I had a question, I would have asked it. So please stop asking me that question over and over again.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the repetition. Let's move on to the next question. Have you been experiencing any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. It's important to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for the last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone available to pick you up after the procedure. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any other questions you have, feel free to ask.\n\nPatient: You know, we've already talked about this.",
