Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: I said Alves.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Alves. I was asking about your understanding of the dietary restrictions and bowel preparation for your colonoscopy. Have you received and understood these instructions?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Alves. It's essential to follow those instructions closely for the best results.
