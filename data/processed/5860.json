        "gpt4": "Excellent, Mr. Alves. Let's move on to discuss your medications. I see on your chart that there's no medication that you need to stop before the colonoscopy. However, could you inform me if you're taking any Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners that we need to be aware of?",
