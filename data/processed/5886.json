    "prompt": "Patient: Yes, please.\n\nNurse: Give me a moment to check how I can best support you.\n\nNurse: Let's first get all the logistics out of the way, Mr. Dang. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. I expected that.\n\nNurse: Okay, thank you for confirming, Mr. Dang. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds exactly the way I thought it would go.\n\nNurse: Thank you for your confirmation, Mr. Dang. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you?\n\nPatient: No. I don't have any concern with the logistics.",
