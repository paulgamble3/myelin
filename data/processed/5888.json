    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay, thank you for confirming, Mr. Dang. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: That sounds exactly the way I thought it would go.\n\nNurse: Thank you for your confirmation, Mr. Dang. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you?\n\nPatient: No. I don't have any concern with the logistics.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Dang. I'm going to move on to talk about your medications, but I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Ready to move on.\n\nNurse: I see on your chart that you're currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day. You'll need to stop this medication 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking Xarelto on August 12. Does that make sense, Mr. Dang?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does.",

        "gpt4": "Great. I also see that you're taking Tylenol for pain management. You can continue taking Tylenol as needed, even on the day of the procedure. Just remember you'll need someone to drive you home afterwards as the procedure involves sedation which can impair your ability to drive. Any questions about your medications, Mr. Dang?",
