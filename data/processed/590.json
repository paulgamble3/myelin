    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad to hear you're doing well and enjoying being home, Ms. Chabot. It's also great that you're taking an interest in your diet. As for your question about Carvedilol and a vegan diet, it's generally recommended to eat a balanced diet. However, it's important to remember that everyone's needs are different. Would you like me to provide some general advice on how to maintain a balanced diet while on a vegan diet?\n\nPatient: Okay. Yeah. Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, Ms. Chabot. When following a vegan diet, it's important to ensure you're getting all the necessary nutrients. This includes protein, iron, calcium, and vitamin B12, which can sometimes be lacking in a vegan diet. Foods like lentils, chickpeas, tofu, and fortified plant milks can help provide these nutrients. However, it's always a good idea to discuss any dietary changes with your doctor or a dietitian, especially when managing conditions like CHF and diabetes. Now, before we move on, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to address?\n\nPatient: Dive was the most you know,\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Chabot, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: important questions that I had. But I wonder also can I\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Chabot. You were saying you had another question?\n\nPatient: Can I use Honey or Stevia as a sugar substitute?",

        "gpt4": "Yes, Ms. Chabot, both honey and stevia can be used as sugar substitutes. However, even though they're natural, they should still be used in moderation as they can raise your blood sugar. Stevia is a particularly good choice as it has zero calories and doesn't cause a rise in blood sugar. Now, could we move on to discuss your current medication regimen?",
        "our_model": "That's a good question, Ms. Chabot. Both honey and Stevia can be used as sugar substitutes. However, it's important to remember that even though they are natural sweeteners, they can still raise your blood sugar levels. If you're managing diabetes, it's a good idea to use these in moderation and always keep an eye on your blood sugar levels. Does that help answer your question?"
