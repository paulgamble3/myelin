I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you.\n\nPatient: It's one twenty eight, like I told you.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming that. It's a bit higher than the target range for fasting blood sugar levels. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations on how to manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent, thank you. One strategy is to ensure you're eating balanced meals with a good mix of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. This can help prevent blood sugar spikes. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: Sonia.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand your response. Could you please let me know what you think about the suggestion to eat balanced meals?\n\nPatient: It sounds good.",
