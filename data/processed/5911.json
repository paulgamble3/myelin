    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for confirming that. It's a bit higher than the target range for fasting blood sugar levels. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations on how to manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent, thank you. One strategy is to ensure you're eating balanced meals with a good mix of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. This can help prevent blood sugar spikes. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: Sonia.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand your response. Could you please let me know what you think about the suggestion to eat balanced meals?\n\nPatient: It sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Another suggestion is to incorporate some physical activity into your day, even if it's just a short walk. This can help your body use insulin more effectively. Do you think you could try that?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
