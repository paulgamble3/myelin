    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent, thank you. One strategy is to ensure you're eating balanced meals with a good mix of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. This can help prevent blood sugar spikes. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: Sonia.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand your response. Could you please let me know what you think about the suggestion to eat balanced meals?\n\nPatient: It sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Another suggestion is to incorporate some physical activity into your day, even if it's just a short walk. This can help your body use insulin more effectively. Do you think you could try that?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Regular physical activity can really make a difference. Now, let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure measurement?\n\nPatient: This morning.",
