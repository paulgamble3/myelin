    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Chabot, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: important questions that I had. But I wonder also can I\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Chabot. You were saying you had another question?\n\nPatient: Can I use Honey or Stevia as a sugar substitute?\n\nNurse: That's a good question, Ms. Chabot. Both honey and Stevia can be used as sugar substitutes. However, it's important to remember that even though they are natural sweeteners, they can still raise your blood sugar levels. If you're managing diabetes, it's a good idea to use these in moderation and always keep an eye on your blood sugar levels. Does that help answer your question?\n\nPatient: That's great to know. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome, Ms. Chabot. I'm glad I could help. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your medications. Are you still taking your existing medications?\n\nPatient: Yes. Go for it.",
