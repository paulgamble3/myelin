        "gpt4": "Excellent, it sounds like you've been able to manage your medication routine really well. I do need to clarify something about the Metoprolol. The correct dosage is actually two 25 mg extended-release (ER) oral tablets daily, not a single 50 mg tablet. Was this communicated to you?",
