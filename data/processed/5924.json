    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great. Now, let's move on to Metoprolol. You should be taking a 50 mg oral tablet daily. Have you been able to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Now, let's discuss Lisinopril. You should be taking a 20 mg oral tablet daily. Have you been able to do that?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. The correct dosage for Metoprolol is actually two 25 mg extended-release (ER) oral tablets daily, not a single 50 mg tablet. Have you been able to take this correct dosage?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. The correct dosage for Lisinopril is actually two 10 mg oral tablets daily, not a single 20 mg tablet. Have you been able to take this correct dosage?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
