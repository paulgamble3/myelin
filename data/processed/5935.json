This means avoiding adding extra salt to your meals and being mindful of processed foods, which often contain hidden sodium. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: Sounds good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that. Another suggestion is to limit your phosphorus intake to 0.8 grams per day.

Lastly, since you have Type II Diabetes, it's beneficial to control your carbohydrate intake. This can be achieved by eating a variety of foods and keeping an eye on portion sizes.
