    "prompt": "Nurse: Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 139 mEq/L, potassium is 3.9 mEq/L, BUN is 4.15 mmol/L, creatinine is 1.0 mg/dL, GFR is 43 mL/min/1.73m2, and urine albumin is 210 mg/g. These tests provide information about your kidney function, blood chemistry, and the amount of protein in your urine. Do you have any specific questions about these results?\n\nPatient: Well, that sure sounds like a lot of mumbo jumbo\n\nNurse: I understand that these results can sound a bit complicated. Let me simplify them for you. Sodium and\n\nPatient: F r me.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?\n\nPatient: And and then and how do you measure it?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: What does GFR mean? And how is it measured? I'm confused.",

        "gpt4": "I apologize for any confusion. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It is a measure of how well your kidneys are filtering wastes from your blood. A lower GFR indicates that your kidneys are not working as well as they should. It is calculated based on your age, sex, body size, and blood creatinine levels. Can I assist with any other questions?",
        "our_model": "Of course, I'd be happy to explain. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A lower GFR can be a sign that your kidneys are not working as well as they should. Your GFR is 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are not filtering your blood as effectively as they could be. Does that help clarify things a bit?"
