    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand that these results can sound a bit complicated. Let me simplify them for you. Sodium and\n\nPatient: F r me.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?\n\nPatient: And and then and how do you measure it?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: What does GFR mean? And how is it measured? I'm confused.\n\nNurse: Of course, I'd be happy to explain. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A lower GFR can be a sign that your kidneys are not working as well as they should. Your GFR is 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are not filtering your blood as effectively as they could be. Does that help clarify things a bit?\n\nPatient: Not",
