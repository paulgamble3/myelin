    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: What does GFR mean? And how is it measured? I'm confused.\n\nNurse: Of course, I'd be happy to explain. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A lower GFR can be a sign that your kidneys are not working as well as they should. Your GFR is 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are not filtering your blood as effectively as they could be. Does that help clarify things a bit?\n\nPatient: Not\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?\n\nPatient: I didn't send anything.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. If it's alright with you, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is that okay?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great. One of the medications you're currently taking is Valsartan 40 mg, which you take once daily. This medication is known as an angiotensin receptor blocker or ARB and it's often prescribed for high blood pressure and heart failure. Can you confirm that you're taking this medication as prescribed?",
