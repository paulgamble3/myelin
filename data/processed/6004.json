        "gpt4": "I understand your concern. Different salad dressings have varying levels of sodium. In general, it's always good to check the nutrition facts on the label. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for sodium is less than 2,300 mg - that's about 1 teaspoon of table salt. Specifically for Wishbone Italian dressing, one serving (2 tablespoons) contains 320 mg of sodium, which is quite high. There isn't a one-size-fits-all answer because sodium needs can vary, especially for patients with diet restrictions due to conditions such as hypertension or kidney diseases. But as a general guideline, foods with less than 120 mg of sodium per 100 grams are considered low in sodium. Would you like some suggestions on alternatives or how to make your own low-sodium dressing?",
