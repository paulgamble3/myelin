    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat what you just said?\n\nPatient: okay. I mean, is there a lot of salt in that or something? Or or\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: or can I eat it? Because I really like it.\n\nNurse: I understand that you enjoy Wishbone salad dressing. It's important to enjoy what you eat. However, many salad dressings, including Wishbone, can be high in sodium. Sodium is something that people with kidney disease need to monitor closely. Would it be alright if I provide some alternatives or suggestions on how to adjust your current salad dressing to align better with the renal diet?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. One option could be to make your own salad dressing at home using ingredients like olive oil, vinegar, lemon juice, and herbs. This can help you control the amount of sodium in your dressing. Another suggestion is to look for low-sodium versions of your favorite salad dressings. They can be a bit harder to find, but they do exist. Lastly, you could try using less dressing overall. This can help reduce the amount of sodium you're consuming. Does that sound doable to you?\n\nPatient: I can try.",
