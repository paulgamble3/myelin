    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Koroleva. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 10:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Koroleva. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Koroleva. Is there anything else about the logistics that\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds worrying you?\n\nPatient: No. Nothing's worrying me. I'm just busy.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your time, Mr. Koroleva. I'll make this as quick as possible. Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yep.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Koroleva. I can see from your chart that you're currently taking Xarelto 10 mg, once a day. You would need to stop this medication five days before your procedure. Considering the date today, you should stop taking Xarelto on August 12. Does that make sense?",
