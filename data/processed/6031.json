I'm just busy.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your time, Mr. Koroleva. I'll make this as quick as possible. Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Koroleva.

That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
