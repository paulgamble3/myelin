I'm just busy.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your time, Mr. Koroleva. I'll make this as quick as possible. Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Are you okay to continue?\n\nPatient: Yep.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Koroleva. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day. For your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Koroleva. Do you have any questions about Xarelto or the instructions to stop it?\n\nPatient: No.",
