This means you can eat foods like white bread, rice, and pasta, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Koroleva. What are some low fiber foods that you enjoy?\n\nPatient: Red rolls.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Koroleva, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: Bread rolls.\n\nNurse: Ah, bread rolls! Those can be a part of your low fiber diet. Do you have a favorite way to eat them?\n\nPatient: With my mouth.",
