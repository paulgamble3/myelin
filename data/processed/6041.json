    "prompt": "Nurse: Ah, bread rolls! Those can be a part of your low fiber diet. Do you have a favorite way to eat them?\n\nPatient: With my mouth.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Koroleva, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: How do you normally prepare red bread rolls you just eat them.\n\nNurse: I see, Mr. Koroleva. Bread rolls can be a comfort food for many. This is one of those rare times when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. In addition to the diet changes, you'll also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.",
