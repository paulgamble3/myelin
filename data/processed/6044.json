    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. In addition to the diet changes, you'll also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Koroleva. These types of supplements can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine. Please continue.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Koroleva. I understand that this part can be a bit challenging. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Koroleva. As part of the prep, you don't have to do anything just yet. But, you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure. This involves drinking only clear liquids with no solid foods and drinking either clear or light-colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Would it be helpful if I provide you with examples of the type of clear liquids you can have?",
