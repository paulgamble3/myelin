    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Koroleva. These types of supplements can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it?\n\nPatient: Fine. Please continue.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Koroleva. I understand that this part can be a bit challenging. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: I guess.",

        "gpt4": "Great, Mr. Koroleva. Clear liquids include things like water, green tea, clear broth, light-colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. This diet will help ensure that your bowel is clear for the colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about the clear liquid diet?",
