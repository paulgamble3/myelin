    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. If you change your mind, remember that you can drink the laxative solution cold. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: I just told you I didn't want any tips. Why did you tell me to\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion, Mr. Koroleva. I was providing additional information in case you were interested. I'll make sure to respect your preferences moving forward. Do you have any other questions about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. The next part of your prep is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.",
