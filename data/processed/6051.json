    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. If you change your mind, remember that you can drink the laxative solution cold. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: I just told you I didn't want any tips. Why did you tell me to\n\nNurse: I apologize for any confusion, Mr. Koroleva. I was providing additional information in case you were interested. I'll make sure to respect your preferences moving forward. Do you have any other questions about the bowel prep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. The next part of your prep is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions about anything we've discussed so far?\n\nPatient: Will I be able to go back to work right after my colonoscopy?",

        "gpt4": "That's a good question, Mr. Koroleva. Since sedation or anaesthesia is typically used during a colonoscopy procedure, your doctor will advise you to rest for the remainder of the day following your procedure. You can expect to be at the hospital for about 2 to 3 hours from check-in to discharge. Would you like tips on how to make your recovery day more comfortable?",
        "our_model": "That's a great question, Mr. Koroleva. After a colonoscopy, you'll need to rest and recover. You might feel a bit groggy from the sedation, and you'll need to arrange for someone to drive you home. It's generally recommended to take the rest of the day off from work. However, everyone's recovery is different, and it's important to listen to your body. Does that answer your question?"
