    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Koroleva. It's important to be in good health before a procedure like a colonoscopy. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's okay, Mr. Koroleva. You still have time to figure it out. But you will indeed need to get someone to be on standby to come pick you up when the hospital calls. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Can I just drive my cell phone?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Koroleva, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: Can't I just drive my self home?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Koroleva, but it's not safe for you to drive yourself home after the procedure. The sedation used during the colonoscopy can make you drowsy and it's important to have someone else drive you home. Do you have a friend or family member who could help with this?\n\nPatient: I don't know.",

        "gpt4": "That's alright, Mr. Koroleva. You still have some time to make arrangements. You could also consider arranging for a ride service or taxi if necessary. I'll note down that your care team should reach out to discuss this further. Is there anything else you would like to explore about this?",
