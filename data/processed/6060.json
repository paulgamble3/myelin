    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Koroleva, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: Can't I just drive my self home?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Koroleva, but it's not safe for you to drive yourself home after the procedure. The sedation used during the colonoscopy can make you drowsy and it's important to have someone else drive you home. Do you have a friend or family member who could help with this?\n\nPatient: I don't know.\n\nNurse: That's okay, Mr. Koroleva. You still have time to figure it out. It's important to have someone available to drive you home after the procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "I appreciate your time, Mr. Koroleva. To summarize our conversation today, we reviewed the logistics for your colonoscopy such as the date and time, where to check in, and your current medication Xarelto. We also discussed diet changes including starting a low fiber diet, moving to a clear liquid diet, and stopping supplements or anti-diarrheal medications. We covered how to take NuLYTELY laxative solution, stopping all intake 4 hours before the procedure, and arranging a ride home. Do these points sound right to you, Mr. Koroleva?",
