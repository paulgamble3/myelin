    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Koroleva, but it's not safe for you to drive yourself home after the procedure. The sedation used during the colonoscopy can make you drowsy and it's important to have someone else drive you home. Do you have a friend or family member who could help with this?\n\nPatient: I don't know.\n\nNurse: That's okay, Mr. Koroleva. You still have time to figure it out. It's important to have someone available to drive you home after the procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Koroleva. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 11:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over your medication, Xarelto, and the need to stop it 5 days before the procedure. We also talked about your diet, including a low fiber diet starting today and a clear liquid diet 24 hours before the procedure. We also discussed the bowel prep with the NuLYTELY laxative solution. Lastly, we confirmed that you'll need someone to drive you home after the procedure. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
