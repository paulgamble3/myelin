This includes eating a variety of foods in the right proportions, such as lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. It's also important to limit foods high in sugar. What do you think about this suggestion?\n\nPatient: But I I'm not hearing you. You're cutting in and out.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. You mentioned that your blood sugar level was 128. Is that correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
