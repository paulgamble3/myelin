    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for that information. Could you please share with me what the result was?\n\nPatient: One ten over eighty.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's good to see that you're keeping track of your blood pressure. Do you have any questions or concerns about your blood pressure or how to manage it?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Well, actually, I don't know what they are.\n\nNurse: I see, would it be okay if I explain them to you in a simple and patient-friendly way?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Absolutely. So, in your recent labs, your Sodium (Na) levels were 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L), which is within the normal range, and it essentially shows the level of salt in your blood. Your Potassium (K) level was 3.7 mEq/L, also within the expected range, and that is important for muscle function including the heart. Your BUN, which stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen, was 7.12 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) and it gives us an idea of how well your kidneys are working. The creatinine level was 1.0 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Creatinine is a waste product that the kidneys clear from the body. The GFR, which means Glomerular Filtration Rate, was 55 milliliters per minute. The GFR provides an estimate of how well your kidneys are filtering out wastes and extra fluid. Your Albumin levels in the urine were 121 milligrams per gram, which tells us about any possible protein leakage from the kidneys. Do you have further questions about these?",
        "our_model": "Excellent. Your sodium level, which is important for many body functions, is 145 mEq/L. This is within the normal range. Your potassium level, which helps your nerves and muscles work properly, is 3.7 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, measures the amount of waste product in your blood and is 7.12 mmol/L. Your creatinine, a waste product from muscle activity, is 1.0 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste and is 55 mL/min/1.73m2. Lastly, your urine albumin, a protein that can indicate kidney damage, is 121 mg/g. Do you have any questions about these results?"
