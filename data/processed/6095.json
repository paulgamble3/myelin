Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, measures the amount of waste product in your blood and is 7.12 mmol/L. Your creatinine, a waste product from muscle activity, is 1.0 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste and is 55 mL/min/1.73m2. Lastly, your urine albumin, a protein that can indicate kidney damage, is 121 mg/g. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: What was my password?\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Jon, I didn't quite catch that.
