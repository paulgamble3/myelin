        "gpt4": "Insulin helps to control the level of sugar in your blood. Even though you have Type II Diabetes, where your body does produce some insulin, it may not make enough, or your body may not use it effectively. That's why you might still need to take insulin. This helps to keep your blood sugar level steady. Does that help to clarify?",
        "our_model": "Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate the amount of sugar in your bloodstream. In people with diabetes, the body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it effectively. Insulin injections, like Lantus, can help control blood sugar levels. Does that help clarify things for you?"
