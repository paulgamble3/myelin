        "gpt4": "Metoprolol is a type of medication known as a beta-blocker that's used to treat high blood pressure and chest pain. Metoprolol ER, or extended-release, is a form of the medication that's designed to be released slowly over time. This is different from regular metoprolol, which is released all at once into your system. Both forms of the medication work to lower blood pressure, reduce chest pain, and improve survival after a heart attack. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this medication?",
        "our_model": "Metoprolol ER, which you're currently taking, is an extended-release version of metoprolol. It's designed to release the medication slowly into your body over time. Regular metoprolol, on the other hand, is released into your body more quickly. Your doctor likely switched you to Metoprolol ER to provide a more consistent level of the medication in your body. Does that answer your question?"
