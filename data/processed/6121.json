    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to take your medications as prescribed to manage your conditions effectively. Now, I'd like to remind you that there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for CKD patients to take. It's always best to talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: I have a question about metoprolol.\n\nNurse: Of course, what's your question about Metoprolol?\n\nPatient: Range between\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Jon, could you please repeat your question about Metoprolol?\n\nPatient: metoprolol ER and regular metoprolol. Which I used to take.\n\nNurse: Metoprolol ER, which you're currently taking, is an extended-release version of metoprolol. It's designed to release the medication slowly into your body over time. Regular metoprolol, on the other hand, is released into your body more quickly. Your doctor likely switched you to Metoprolol ER to provide a more consistent level of the medication in your body. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
