        "gpt4": "Fantastic! So, for a CKD patient, it's often recommended to have a sodium-limited diet with less than 2000 mg of sodium per day. Options could be to enjoy fresh vegetables, fruits, lean meats, and whole grains, which are typically low in sodium. Also, try to avoid processed and fast foods, as they can be high in sodium. What do you think of these suggestions?",
