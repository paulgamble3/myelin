    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Jon, could you please repeat that?\n\nPatient: I said I smoke a pack of cigarettes today. Okay.\n\nNurse: I see, thank you for sharing that. I know it's a sensitive topic, but have you ever considered quitting smoking?\n\nPatient: I'm not ready to quit right now. Thanks.\n\nNurse: That's completely okay. It's a big step and it's important to do it when you're ready. Can you share with me why you feel you're not ready to quit smoking yet?\n\nPatient: I just don't want to.\n\nNurse: I understand. It's a personal decision and it's important to do what feels right for you. If you ever change your mind, I have a lot of resources that could help you. Would you like me to share them with you now, or would you prefer to wait until you're ready?\n\nPatient: Not right now.",
