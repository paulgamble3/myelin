    "prompt": "Nurse: That sounds wonderful, Ms. Raynier. Riding a bike and visiting the beach are such great ways to enjoy your new knee. How long have these activities been on hold for you?\n\nPatient: You know, and I'm nervous about the procedure, but I want it to be over.\n\nNurse: It sounds like you have some wonderful plans ahead, Ms. Raynier. Riding your bike and visiting the beach will be such enjoyable activities, especially after being able to move more freely with your new knee. It's completely normal to feel a bit nervous about the procedure. How are you feeling about it overall?\n\nPatient: A little bit nervous, little bit anxious,\n\nNurse: It's completely normal to feel a bit nervous and anxious, Ms. Raynier. Rest assured, your surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, is highly experienced and has performed over 1000 total knee replacements. Before we move on, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Will I be in pain after the surgery? Will I be able to walk?\n\nNurse: It's completely normal to feel nervous and ask these questions, Ms. Raynier. After the surgery, there will be some pain, but it will be managed with medications. As for walking, it's important to remember that everyone's recovery process is different, but generally, most people are able to stand and take a few steps with the help of a walker or crutches on the day of surgery. Over time, with physical therapy and rehabilitation, you'll regain your strength and mobility. Before we move on, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I can't think of any.",
