Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Give me a moment while I figure out how I can best help you. Give me a moment while I figure out how I can best help you. Alright, Mr. Dang. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you.

Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Dang. Now let's talk about your medications. I see on your chart that you are prescribed Xarelto 10 mg, to be taken once per day. You would need to stop Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. Considering today's date, you should stop the medication on August 12. Does this make sense to you?",
        "our_model": "Great, Mr. Dang. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day. Given the instructions for your colonoscopy, you will need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense?"
