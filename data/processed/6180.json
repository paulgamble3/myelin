        "gpt4": "I see, it's understandable to feel a bit nervous when facing something new like this. However, rest assured, your gastroenterologist, Dr. Meredith Bailey, is really excellent in her field. She has performed over 1500 colonoscopies and has trained at leading institutions such as Cornell Medical School and Stanford University Hospital. Would it help to know more details about what to expect during and after the procedure?",
