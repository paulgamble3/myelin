        "gpt4": "Great, Ms. Shannon. Let's go through some details. \n\nFirst, I want to remind you that your colonoscopy is an important step towards understanding and maintaining your health. The goal of this procedure is to look into your colon and check for any abnormalities. Dr. Meredith Bailey, your gastroenterologist, is a seasoned professional who has performed over 1500 colonoscopies. \n\nNow, as for the preparation, you will be given specific instructions about what you can eat and drink in the days leading up to the procedure, since your colon needs to be clean for the doctor to see clearly. It often involves a special diet and possibly some laxatives. \n\nDuring the procedure itself, you\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdll be sedated so you won\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt feel or remember the procedure. After it's over, you'll need someone to drive you home since you'll still be experiencing the effects of the sedation. It\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds a common and safe process that is vital in detecting any potential issues early on. \n\nDoes this information help at all, Ms. Shannon?",
