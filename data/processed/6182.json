        "gpt4": "Alright, Ms. Shannon. Here are a few things that need to be done before your colonoscopy procedure:\n\n1. A week before your procedure, you will need to avoid certain foods like seeds, nuts, corn, and popcorn. \n\n2. Three days before the test, you should change your diet to only clear liquids like broths, clear juices, and water.\n\n3. You will also need to take a special solution, pill, or laxative prescribed by your doctor. This is often taken the night before and the morning of the test to clean out the colon.\n\n4. Finally, do not eat or drink anything two hours before the procedure.\n\nRemember, before the procedure, the medical personnel will verify your identity to ensure patient safety. They will explain the procedure to you and you'll have an opportunity to ask any questions. \n\nIt's essential that you follow all these steps to ensure the colonoscopy goes as effectively as possible. Do you have any questions about these instructions, or is there anything else you're concerned about?",
        "our_model": "I'm glad you're open to discussing this, Ms. Shannon. Before we dive into the details, I want to reassure you that you're in excellent hands. Your gastroenterologist, Doctor Meredith Bailey, is highly experienced and has performed over 1500 colonoscopies. She's known for her skill and compassionate care. Now, let's talk about the procedure. It's a process to check for any issues in your colon, like polyps or early signs of cancer. It's a preventative screening, which means it's done to catch any potential problems early, when they're easier to treat. How are you feeling about this information?"
