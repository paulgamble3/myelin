Before we dive into the details, I want to reassure you that you're in excellent hands. Your gastroenterologist, Doctor Meredith Bailey, is highly experienced and has performed over 1500 colonoscopies. She's known for her skill and compassionate care. Now, let's talk about the procedure. It's a process to check for any issues in your colon, like polyps or early signs of cancer. It's a preventative screening, which means it's done to catch any potential problems early, when they're easier to treat. How are you feeling about this information?\n\nPatient: Still really nervous.",
