    "prompt": "Patient: I've never had a colonoscopy before.\n\nNurse: I see, Ms. Shannon. It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious when facing a new medical procedure. I'm here to help you understand the process and hopefully alleviate some of your concerns. Would you like me to go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Give me a moment to check how I can best support you.\n\nNurse: I'm glad you're open to discussing this, Ms. Shannon. Before we dive into the details, I want to reassure you that you're in excellent hands. Your gastroenterologist, Doctor Meredith Bailey, is highly experienced and has performed over 1500 colonoscopies. She's known for her skill and compassionate care. Now, let's talk about the procedure. It's a process to check for any issues in your colon, like polyps or early signs of cancer. It's a preventative screening, which means it's done to catch any potential problems early, when they're easier to treat. How are you feeling about this information?\n\nPatient: Still really nervous.\n\nNurse: I can see why you might feel nervous, Ms. Shannon. It's a big step to take, but it's an important one for your health. I'm here to help you through it. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: No. I just am so, so, so, so, so, so, so so scared.",

        "gpt4": "I can certainly understand how you feel and I want you to know that these feelings are completely normal. It's okay to be scared. If it helps, know that your medical team is highly experienced and will do their utmost to keep you comfortable and safe during the procedure. Also, you won't feel any pain because you will be under light anesthesia. If you wish, we can arrange for you to speak with your doctor or a nurse who can explain the procedure in more detail and answer any questions you may have. Would that make you feel more at ease?",
