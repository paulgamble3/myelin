    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm glad you're open to discussing this, Ms. Shannon. Before we dive into the details, I want to reassure you that you're in excellent hands. Your gastroenterologist, Doctor Meredith Bailey, is highly experienced and has performed over 1500 colonoscopies. She's known for her skill and compassionate care. Now, let's talk about the procedure. It's a process to check for any issues in your colon, like polyps or early signs of cancer. It's a preventative screening, which means it's done to catch any potential problems early, when they're easier to treat. How are you feeling about this information?\n\nPatient: Still really nervous.\n\nNurse: I can see why you might feel nervous, Ms. Shannon. It's a big step to take, but it's an important one for your health. I'm here to help you through it. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: No. I just am so, so, so, so, so, so, so so scared.\n\nNurse: I hear you, Ms. Shannon. It's okay to feel scared. This is a significant procedure, but it's also a proactive step towards maintaining your health. I'm here to help you understand the process and make sure you're as comfortable as possible. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Ms. Shannon. Let's start with the preparation. A few days before the procedure, you'll need to start a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. The day before the procedure, you'll need to stick to clear liquids only. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. It's essential to avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. How does that sound so far?\n\nPatient: Hello?",
