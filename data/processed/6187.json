    "prompt": "Nurse: I can see why you might feel nervous, Ms. Shannon. It's a big step to take, but it's an important one for your health. I'm here to help you through it. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward?\n\nPatient: No. I just am so, so, so, so, so, so, so so scared.\n\nNurse: I hear you, Ms. Shannon. It's okay to feel scared. This is a significant procedure, but it's also a proactive step towards maintaining your health. I'm here to help you understand the process and make sure you're as comfortable as possible. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Ms. Shannon. Let's start with the preparation. A few days before the procedure, you'll need to start a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. The day before the procedure, you'll need to stick to clear liquids only. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. It's essential to avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. How does that sound so far?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: Hello, Ms. Shannon. I was explaining the dietary guidelines for the day before your colonoscopy. You'll need to stick to clear liquids only, avoiding any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. How does that sound so far?\n\nPatient: Okay.",

        "gpt4": "Great. Now, the evening before the procedure, you will need to take a special type of laxative that your doctor will prescribe. It's designed to fully cleanse your colon. Because of this, you'll want to be near a bathroom. You may also feel a bit hungry because of the restricted diet, but this is a necessary part of the preparation. I know it may not be the most pleasant preparation, but it's really important for the procedure to be safe and effective. Do you have any questions on this part?",
        "our_model": "I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Shannon. On the day of the procedure, you'll need to take a bowel prep solution. This will help clean out your colon so that Doctor Bailey can get a clear view during the colonoscopy. It's important to follow the instructions on the bowel prep solution carefully. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?"
