    "prompt": "Nurse: I hear you, Ms. Shannon. It's okay to feel scared. This is a significant procedure, but it's also a proactive step towards maintaining your health. I'm here to help you understand the process and make sure you're as comfortable as possible. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Ms. Shannon. Let's start with the preparation. A few days before the procedure, you'll need to start a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. The day before the procedure, you'll need to stick to clear liquids only. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. It's essential to avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. How does that sound so far?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: Hello, Ms. Shannon. I was explaining the dietary guidelines for the day before your colonoscopy. You'll need to stick to clear liquids only, avoiding any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. How does that sound so far?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Shannon. On the day of the procedure, you'll need to take a bowel prep solution. This will help clean out your colon so that Doctor Bailey can get a clear view during the colonoscopy. It's important to follow the instructions on the bowel prep solution carefully. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: I can't hear you.",
