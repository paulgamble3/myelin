    "prompt": "Nurse: Excellent, Ms. Shannon. Let's start with the preparation. A few days before the procedure, you'll need to start a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. The day before the procedure, you'll need to stick to clear liquids only. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. It's essential to avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. How does that sound so far?\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: Hello, Ms. Shannon. I was explaining the dietary guidelines for the day before your colonoscopy. You'll need to stick to clear liquids only, avoiding any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. How does that sound so far?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Shannon. On the day of the procedure, you'll need to take a bowel prep solution. This will help clean out your colon so that Doctor Bailey can get a clear view during the colonoscopy. It's important to follow the instructions on the bowel prep solution carefully. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation?\n\nPatient: I can't hear you.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Ms. Shannon. I was saying that it's important to follow the instructions on the bowel prep solution carefully. This will help ensure that your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: It just sounds gross.",

        "gpt4": "Understandably, the preparation for a colonoscopy, specifically the bowel preparation, might not be the most pleasant experience. However, it's a necessary step to ensure that your doctor can get a clear view of your colon during the procedure. The prep solution does not have a great taste for most people, but remember, it's only temporary and it's for a good cause - your health. Are there any further questions or concerns you'd like to address, Ms. Shannon?",
        "our_model": "I understand, Ms. Shannon. The preparation can indeed sound a bit unpleasant. However, it's a crucial part of the process to ensure that Doctor Bailey can perform the colonoscopy effectively. Would you like me to note down your feelings for your care team to review?"
