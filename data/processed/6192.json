    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry for the inconvenience, Ms. Shannon. I was saying that it's important to follow the instructions on the bowel prep solution carefully. This will help ensure that your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: It just sounds gross.\n\nNurse: I understand, Ms. Shannon. The preparation can indeed sound a bit unpleasant. However, it's a crucial part of the process to ensure that Doctor Bailey can perform the colonoscopy effectively. Would you like me to note down your feelings for your care team to review?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: I've noted down your feelings about the preparation process, Ms. Shannon. It's completely normal to feel this way. Now, on the day of the procedure, you'll be given a sedative to help you relax. You'll be asleep during the procedure and won't feel any discomfort. When you wake up, you might feel a bit groggy, but this is normal. You'll need someone to drive you home after the procedure. How does that sound?\n\nPatient: I'm nervous.\n\nNurse: I can see why you might be feeling nervous, Ms. Shannon. It's a normal reaction to feeling anxious before a procedure. However, please remember that you're in the hands of a highly skilled and experienced doctor. Doctor Bailey has performed over 1500 colonoscopies and is known for her excellent care. Would you like me to note down your feelings of nervousness for your care team to review?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
