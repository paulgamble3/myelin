    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: cotherapy and exercises that I'm supposed to be doing afterwards\n\nNurse: Yes, that's correct. Physical therapy and exercises are a crucial part of the recovery process after a total knee replacement. They help to strengthen the muscles around your new knee and improve your mobility. Do you have any specific questions or concerns about this part of the recovery process?\n\nPatient: Why did doctors insist on that when that just makes the joint pain worse?\n\nNurse: That's a great question. Physical therapy and exercises are an important part of recovery after a knee replacement. They help to strengthen the muscles around your new joint and improve your mobility. While it's true that some exercises might cause some discomfort initially, they are designed to help you regain function and reduce pain in the long run. Would it be okay if we review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure now?\n\nPatient: I'm not able to hear you.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the inconvenience. I was saying that while it's true that some exercises might cause discomfort initially, they are designed to help improve your mobility and strengthen the muscles around your new joint. This should ultimately lead to less pain and a better recovery. Would it be okay if we review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure now?\n\nPatient: Good idea.",

        "gpt4": "Thank you. Let's first get all the logistics sorted. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Dr. Cristina Stevens. The hospital asks that you arrive about 1 hour before, so that would be at 8:00 AM. Is that clear and okay with you?",
