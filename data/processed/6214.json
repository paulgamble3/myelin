    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great question. Physical therapy and exercises are an important part of recovery after a knee replacement. They help to strengthen the muscles around your new joint and improve your mobility. While it's true that some exercises might cause some discomfort initially, they are designed to help you regain function and reduce pain in the long run. Would it be okay if we review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure now?\n\nPatient: I'm not able to hear you.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the inconvenience. I was saying that while it's true that some exercises might cause discomfort initially, they are designed to help improve your mobility and strengthen the muscles around your new joint. This should ultimately lead to less pain and a better recovery. Would it be okay if we review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure now?\n\nPatient: Good idea.\n\nNurse: Great. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Go ahead.\n\nNurse: Are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens.
