I was saying that while it's true that some exercises might cause discomfort initially, they are designed to help improve your mobility and strengthen the muscles around your new joint. This should ultimately lead to less pain and a better recovery. Would it be okay if we review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure now?\n\nPatient: Good idea.\n\nNurse: Great. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Go ahead.\n\nNurse: Are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens.
