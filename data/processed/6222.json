    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Tylenol 500 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so. No.\n\nNurse: Alright. It's essential to note that medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I've got it right here.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Do you have any questions about this medication or any other medications you're currently taking?\n\nPatient: No.",
