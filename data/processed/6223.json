    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No. I don't think so. No.\n\nNurse: Alright. It's essential to note that medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I've got it right here.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Do you have any questions about this medication or any other medications you're currently taking?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: I have it. Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great. I'll go over the instructions for how to use the scrub. You will need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. The first step is to take a regular shower. Once you're done, turn off the water. Does that sound okay so far?",
        "our_model": "That's excellent. The chlorhexidine scrub is to be used the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions one by one. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?"
