    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. It's essential to note that medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I also notice that you've been prescribed Oxycodone 10 mg four times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked up this prescription yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I've got it right here.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Do you have any questions about this medication or any other medications you're currently taking?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright. Now, let's talk about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub?\n\nPatient: I have it. Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. The chlorhexidine scrub is to be used the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions one by one. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far?\n\nPatient: It does.",

        "gpt4": "Great. After that, you'll apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth. Then, you'll gently scrub yourself from the neck down. You should avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Will you be comfortable doing that?",
