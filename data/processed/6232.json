    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, that's correct. Even water should not be consumed after midnight before your procedure. This is to ensure your stomach is empty for the anesthesia. Do you have any other questions about this?\n\nPatient: No other questions.\n\nNurse: Alright. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Please continue.\n\nNurse: Thank you. My next question is about your current health status. Do you have any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: Well, my knee is hurting. Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that your knee is hurting. That's to be expected given the condition of your knee joint. However, I'm asking about general signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches. Have you experienced any of these recently?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the knee is a joint",
