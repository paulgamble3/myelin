    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Please continue.\n\nNurse: Thank you. My next question is about your current health status. Do you have any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: Well, my knee is hurting. Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that your knee is hurting. That's to be expected given the condition of your knee joint. However, I'm asking about general signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches. Have you experienced any of these recently?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the knee is a joint\n\nNurse: Yes, the knee is indeed a joint. I apologize if my question was unclear. I'm asking about general signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches that are not specific to your knee joint. Have you experienced any of these recently?\n\nPatient: but I thought that the muscles were attached, and they have been aching too.",

        "gpt4": "I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing some additional aches. It's common to have some associated muscle aches when dealing with joint issues. However, for this question, we're looking for symptoms of a general illness, like a cold or the flu. These would include symptoms not associated with your knee, like a fever, chills, cough, or general body aches. Have you experienced any of these symptoms recently?",
        "our_model": "I see, so you've been experiencing muscle aches in addition to the knee pain. I'm sorry to hear that. It's critical to note these symptoms. Now, let's move on to the next question. After your procedure, do you plan to go home or will you be staying at a rehab facility?"
