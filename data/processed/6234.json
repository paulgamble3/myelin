    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you. My next question is about your current health status. Do you have any signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: Well, my knee is hurting. Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry to hear that your knee is hurting. That's to be expected given the condition of your knee joint. However, I'm asking about general signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches. Have you experienced any of these recently?\n\nPatient: Well, I guess the knee is a joint\n\nNurse: Yes, the knee is indeed a joint. I apologize if my question was unclear. I'm asking about general signs of illness such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches that are not specific to your knee joint. Have you experienced any of these recently?\n\nPatient: but I thought that the muscles were attached, and they have been aching too.\n\nNurse: I see, so you've been experiencing muscle aches in addition to the knee pain. I'm sorry to hear that. It's critical to note these symptoms. Now, let's move on to the next question. After your procedure, do you plan to go home or will you be staying at a rehab facility?\n\nPatient: I'll be going home.",

        "gpt4": "Great, going home is usually the most comfortable option. Just to confirm, you have someone who can pick you up after your procedure and stay with you for a few days? This is important for your safety.",
        "our_model": "That's good to hear. It's important to have a comfortable and safe place to recover. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?"
