    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to have a comfortable and safe place to recover. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Daughter will be with me for the duration.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful to hear that your daughter will be there to support you. Will she also be able to drive you home after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Of course.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone you trust to help you during this time. If there's anything else you need, don't hesitate to ask. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns?\n\nPatient: No. I can't think of anything at the moment.\n\nNurse: Alright. Just to summarize, before your procedure, remember to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Also, remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
