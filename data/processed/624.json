    "prompt": "Nurse: Hold on a second while I figure out how I can best support you. I apologize for misunderstanding, Ms. Raynier. I'm glad to hear that you're comfortable speaking with me. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.\n\nNurse: Okay, Ms. Raynier. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Ms. Raynier. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Raynier. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications, but I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Alright, Ms. Raynier. Thank you for confirming. I see on your chart that you're currently on Plavix, a 75 mg dose once a day. I hope you're aware that this medication needs to be stopped 7 days before your procedure. Given today's date, have you already stopped taking your Plavix?",
        "our_model": "Perfect, Ms. Raynier. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Plavix 75 mg once a day. As per the instructions, you were told to stop this medication 7 days prior to your procedure. Have you already stopped taking Plavix?"
