    "prompt": "Nurse: Okay, Ms. Raynier. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Ms. Raynier. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Raynier. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear to you. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications, but I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Can we proceed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Ms. Raynier. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Plavix 75 mg once a day. As per the instructions, you were told to stop this medication 7 days prior to your procedure. Have you already stopped taking Plavix?\n\nPatient: Yes, ma'am.",
