    "prompt": "Patient: Yes.\n\nPatient: I have.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Alves. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yes. It's okay with me.\n\nNurse: Perfect, Mr. Alves. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Alves.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Alves, could you please confirm if the check-in location on the 1st Floor of O'Connor Hospital sounds good to you?\n\nPatient: I said Alves.",
