    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on?\n\nPatient: Mhmm.Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you, Mr. Alves. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications in preparation for your colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Alves. It's important to avoid those medications before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: Let's just move on.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: Y'all always encouraging us to eat",

        "gpt4": "It sounds like you're noting a contradiction, Mr. Alves, and you're absolutely right. Normally, we do encourage a high-fiber diet because of its many health benefits. But in this case, a low fiber diet for a few days will help ensure your colon is as clear as possible for the procedure. This is why we temporarily recommend foods like white bread, pasta, and rice. That said, is there a particular low fiber food that you enjoy? Perhaps as a comfort food?",
