    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Alves. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications in preparation for your colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Alves. It's important to avoid those medications before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic?\n\nPatient: Let's just move on.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet?\n\nPatient: Y'all always encouraging us to eat\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Alves, could you please repeat what you were saying?\n\nPatient: high highly rich food with fiber.",

        "our_model": "You're correct, Mr. Alves. In general, a high fiber diet is beneficial for our health. However, in preparation for a colonoscopy, a low fiber diet is recommended to ensure the colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any favorite low fiber foods that you might consider as comfort food?"
