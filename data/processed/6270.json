In general, a high fiber diet is beneficial for our health. However, in preparation for a colonoscopy, a low fiber diet is recommended to ensure the colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any favorite low fiber foods that you might consider as comfort food?\n\nPatient: And now I cannot have it.\n\nNurse: You're correct, Mr. Alves. It's a bit unusual for doctors to recommend a low fiber diet. This is because a high fiber diet can leave residue in the colon that might interfere with the colonoscopy.

Bread and pasta made from white flour are also good options. Soft, ripe bananas and melons can also be part of your diet. Enjoying these types of food in the days leading up to your colonoscopy can make the preparation a bit easier. What do you think of these examples?",
