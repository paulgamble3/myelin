    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Raynier. You're doing exactly what you need to do to prepare for your procedure. Do you have any questions about Plavix or why it was necessary to stop it before your surgery?\n\nPatient: No. I understand.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Raynier. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Raynier. It's important to avoid those medications before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol and Tramadol for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have. Are you still there, Rachel?\n\nNurse: Yes, I'm here, Ms. Raynier. That's great to hear that you've already picked up your post-procedure medications. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.",

Now, let's talk about something important to your surgery preparation, which is the use of a chlorhexidine scrub to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased this scrub? It should be available at most local pharmacies.",
