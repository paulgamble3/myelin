        "gpt4": "Absolutely, Mr. Alves. GoLYTELY is a laxative solution that helps cleanse your colon before your colonoscopy. The aim is to clear out any stools so that your doctor is able to see everything clearly during your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6 PM the day before your procedure. Can I provide additional information about this?",
        "our_model": "Absolutely, Mr. Alves. The clear liquid diet is often the hardest part of the prep because it requires you to avoid solid foods. You'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?"
