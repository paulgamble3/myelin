The clear liquid diet is often the hardest part of the prep because it requires you to avoid solid foods. You'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet?\n\nPatient: Yes. Sure.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Mr. Alves. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's important to note that you should avoid any beverages or gelatin that are red or purple. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: What what is the clear liquids are?\n\nNurse: Clear liquids are any liquids that you can see through.
