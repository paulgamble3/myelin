Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: didn't say anything.\n\nNurse: My apologies for the confusion, Mr. Alves. Let's continue. Do you have any remaining questions about the clear liquid diet?\n\nPatient: No. I do not.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier?\n\nPatient: Mhmm.",

        "gpt4": "Great, the GoLYTELY solution works by clearing out your intestines, which is essential for the colonoscopy. However, it can be a little hard to handle because it is quite a lot of liquid and it doesn't taste great. Here are some tips that might make it a little easier to handle:\n\n1. You can add a flavor packet to it - lemon or lime usually works best.\n2. Chill it in the fridge.\n3. Drink it through a straw to bypass the taste buds on your tongue.\n4. Follow each gulp of solution with a sip of a clear liquid that you actually enjoy, like apple juice or lemonade, to help get rid of the taste.\n\nRemember, it is very important to finish all the solution. It might seem like a lot, but it's necessary to ensure your colon is clear for the procedure.\n\nDo you have any questions about this, Mr. Alves?",
