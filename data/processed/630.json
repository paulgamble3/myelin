    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Ms. Raynier. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of?\n\nPatient: No. I'm not.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Raynier. It's important to avoid those medications before surgery unless specifically recommended by your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol and Tramadol for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications yet?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have. Are you still there, Rachel?\n\nNurse: Yes, I'm here, Ms. Raynier. That's great to hear that you've already picked up your post-procedure medications. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns?\n\nPatient: No. I don't.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Raynier. If any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased a chlorhexidine scrub?\n\nPatient: Yes. I have.",

        "gpt4": "That's great to hear, Ms. Raynier. Let's go over the instructions on how to use it correctly. You'll need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you'll take a shower like normal and then turn the water off. Is this sounding good so far?",
