        "gpt4": "Of course, Mr. Alves. After you begin drinking your GoLYTELY laxative solution, it usually takes about an hour to start working. Once it starts, you'll experience frequent, loose bowel movements. This is normal and is a sign that the solution is working to cleanse your colon for the colonoscopy.\n\nYou'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6 PM the evening before your procedure. Then, wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. You'll need to completely finish the solution and stop taking in any liquids 4 hours before your procedure time. Does that clarify things for you?",
