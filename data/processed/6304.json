    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. Let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Okay, Mr.\n\nPatient: No questions.\n\nNurse: Great, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we move on, do you have any questions or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: But can you tell me about how long it's gonna last? The go lightly. And when do I need to take it?\n\nNurse: Of course,\n\nPatient: Great ticket.",

        "gpt4": "Mr. Alves. You'll start drinking your GoLYTELY laxative solution the day before your procedure around 6PM. You'll drink 8 ounces of the solution every 10 minutes until half the bottle is gone. Then, you'll wake up early the morning of your procedure and start drinking another 8 ounces of the solution every 10 minutes until you finish the bottle. This will cause multiple bowel movements to clean out your colon for the procedure. The exact timing and your response to the solution can vary, but you should expect to spend a few hours the night before and a few hours the morning of your procedure on this.  Does that answer your question, Mr. Alves?",
        "our_model": "Of course, Of course, Mr. Alves. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM the day before your procedure. Then, you'll wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. The bowel prep process usually takes about 1 to 2 hours to complete, but it can vary from person to person. Does that answer your question?"
