    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I appreciate your patience. My next question is about your current health status. Have you been experiencing any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Alves. It's critical to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.\n\nNurse: That's okay, Mr. Alves. You still have time to arrange a ride home after your procedure. It's essential to have someone available to pick you up when the hospital calls. Do you have any family or friends who could help with this?\n\nPatient: I'll think about it. I still have how many days, seven days a week. Right?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Alves, you have a week to arrange a ride home after your procedure. It's important to have someone on standby to pick you up when the hospital calls. Do you have any other questions or concerns about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I think I'm okay.",
