    "prompt": "Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Alves. It's critical to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after your procedure?\n\nPatient: No. I haven't.\n\nNurse: That's okay, Mr. Alves. You still have time to arrange a ride home after your procedure. It's essential to have someone available to pick you up when the hospital calls. Do you have any family or friends who could help with this?\n\nPatient: I'll think about it. I still have how many days, seven days a week. Right?\n\nNurse: Yes, Mr. Alves, you have a week to arrange a ride home after your procedure. It's important to have someone on standby to pick you up when the hospital calls. Do you have any other questions or concerns about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I think I'm okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I'm good.",

We went over your prep instructions, which includes adhering to a low fiber diet, taking the GoLYTELY laxative solution, and arranging a ride home after. Does that all sound correct?",
