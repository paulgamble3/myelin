    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, Mr. Alves, you have a week to arrange a ride home after your procedure. It's important to have someone on standby to pick you up when the hospital calls. Do you have any other questions or concerns about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I think I'm okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay. That was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: No. I'm good.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Mr. Alves. To summarize, we discussed your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. We went over your medications, diet, and bowel prep with GoLYTELY. We also confirmed that you're not currently experiencing any signs of illness. Does that sound right?\n\nPatient: That sounds right. Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Mr. Alves. I'm glad we could go over everything together. Remember, I'm here for you every step of the way. I will call you again the day before the procedure to go over step by step all the prep instructions. If you have any questions in the meantime, you can call us back at 641-381-6523. Does that sound good to you?\n\nPatient: Yes. I'm good.",
