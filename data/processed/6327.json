By the way, do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy in your free time?\n\nPatient: No. I don't. I'm not really a hobby guy.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Gardner. Everyone has their own ways of spending their time. How about pets?\n\nPatient: You're awfully nosy, aren't you?\n\nNurse: I apologize if I seem intrusive, Mr. Gardner.

One way to measure it could be using a measuring cup. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your diet or anything else?"
