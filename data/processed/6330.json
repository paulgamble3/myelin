    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner, your response got cut off. Could you please repeat your question or concern?\n\nPatient: I've been thinking about is the fluid restriction. I'm not sure how to measure that.\n\nNurse: That's a great question, Mr. Gardner. The fluid restriction of 1.5 liters is a daily limit. It includes all fluids, not just water, such as soup, coffee, or any other beverages. One way to measure it could be using a measuring cup. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your diet or anything else?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Gardner. Let's move on to your medications. Have you been able to pick up your new prescription for Lasix 20 mg oral tablets?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Gardner. Are you taking the Lasix 20 mg tablets two times a day as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
