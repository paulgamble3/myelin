    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a great question, Ms. Raynier. On average, knee replacements can last anywhere from 15 to 20 years. However, it can vary depending on several factors such as your activity level, weight, and how well you follow your doctor's instructions after surgery. It's essential to remember that joint replacements are not as durable as your original joints and may need to be replaced at some point. But with proper care, your new knee should serve you well for many years. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could provide the information you were looking for, Ms. Raynier. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches recently?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Raynier. It's critical to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Ms. Raynier. It's essential to have a comfortable and safe place to recover after your procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure?\n\nPatient: Yes. My daughter is going to give me a ride home and help me.",
