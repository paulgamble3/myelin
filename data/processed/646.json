        "gpt4": "Alright, Ms. Raynier. If you have any other questions or concerns later, please do not hesitate to ask. Just to summarize, before your procedure, please remember to use the chlorhexidine scrub as directed, abstain from eating and drinking after midnight before your procedure, and ensure that you have stopped taking Plavix. On the day of the procedure, arrive at O'Connor Hospital by 8:00 AM with a ride arranged for after. Can I count on you to do all of that, Ms. Raynier?",
        "our_model": "Alright, Ms. Raynier. Before we end our call, let's quickly summarize what you still need to do before your procedure. You'll need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure.
