Now, are you still taking Atorvastatin and Lantus?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Lastly, are you still taking Tramadol, Levothyroxine, and Tylenol as needed?\n\nPatient: Tramadol, levothyroxine, and Tylenol as needed. Yes.\n\nNurse: Thank you for confirming that. I understand it can be a lot to manage. It's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: You must be kidding me.\n\nNurse: I understand it can be challenging at times. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some suggestions that might help. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

        "gpt4": "Great. Some people find it helpful to set reminders or alarms. Others use pill organizers or link taking their medication to daily habits like eating a meal. Does that sound like something that might be helpful for you?",
        "our_model": "Wonderful. One strategy could be using a pillbox with compartments for each day of the week. This can help you see at a glance if you've taken your medications for the day. Another option could be setting reminders on your phone or a clock. Would any of these suggestions be helpful for you?"
