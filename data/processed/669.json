    "prompt": "Nurse: I understand it can be challenging at times. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some suggestions that might help. Would that be alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful. One strategy could be using a pillbox with compartments for each day of the week. This can help you see at a glance if you've taken your medications for the day. Another option could be setting reminders on your phone or a clock. Would any of these suggestions be helpful for you?\n\nPatient: I already do those things. It is a full time job\n\nNurse: I see, I can imagine it's quite a task to manage all these medications. You're doing a great job. Now, with your permission, I'd like to ask a few questions about your symptoms to understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: making sure I take care of my medicines.\n\nNurse: I can imagine it's a lot of work. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Yep.",
