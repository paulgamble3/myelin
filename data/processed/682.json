Have you noticed any significant weight gain, such as more than 2 pounds in a day or 5 pounds in a week?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's great. We just performed a simple CHF assessment.

Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: I guess not.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. Could you please confirm if you've been using more pillows to sleep at night?\n\nPatient: I said",
