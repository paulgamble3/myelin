It's important to keep up with your medications. Are you taking them twice a day as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Ms. Peck. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Now, it's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No. I have a tireless thing.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Ms. Peck. Using a pill organizer is a great way to keep track of your medications. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Hello?",
