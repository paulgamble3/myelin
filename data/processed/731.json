    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great, Ms. Peck. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to keep an eye on these symptoms at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: Alright, Ms. Peck. Now, I'd like to talk about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Well, for lunch today.\n\nNurse: Yes,\n\nPatient: I had a tuna sandwich.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a nice lunch, Ms. Peck. How did you prepare your tuna sandwich?\n\nPatient: Use that low carbohydrate bread.",
