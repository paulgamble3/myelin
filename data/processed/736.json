Can you recall what fruit you had for breakfast?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I have some very strawberries and confiseries.\n\nNurse: I'm That's a nice choice, Ms. Peck. Strawberries are a good source of vitamins. Now, I'd like to remind you of your dietary recommendations. You're on a sodium-limited diet with less than 2000 mg of sodium per day.

        "gpt4": "It definitely can be challenging, Ms. Peck, and I appreciate your openness in admitting that. The key is balance. So for managing phosphorus, diluting high-phosphate drinks like milk with water, avoiding dark soda, and eating more fresh fruits and veggies can be helpful. Would more information on this be useful for you?",
        "our_model": "I appreciate your openness, Ms. Peck. It's indeed a bit challenging to manage both sodium and phosphorus intake. For sodium, it's often found in processed foods, so cooking at home can help. When you do use canned goods, rinsing them can remove some sodium. Also, herbs and spices can add flavor without sodium. Would you like more suggestions?"
