    "prompt": "Nurse: I appreciate your openness, Ms. Peck. It's indeed a bit challenging to manage both sodium and phosphorus intake. For sodium, it's often found in processed foods, so cooking at home can help. When you do use canned goods, rinsing them can remove some sodium. Also, herbs and spices can add flavor without sodium. Would you like more suggestions?\n\nPatient: Well, just let me know what I should avoid.\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Peck. Foods high in sodium often include processed meats like ham, bacon, or sausage, canned soups, fast food, and certain cheeses. It's also a good idea to check food labels for sodium content. Now, let's talk about phosphorus. It's often found in dairy products, beans,\n\nPatient: I know you said processed foods, but\n\nNurse: Of course, Ms. Peck. In addition to processed foods, some common foods that can be high in sodium include bread, pizza, sandwiches, cold cuts like the tuna in your sandwich, and soups.\n\nPatient: Anything else?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Ms. Peck. Besides processed foods, some common foods that can be high in sodium include bread, pizza, sandwiches, cold cuts and cured meats, soups, fast foods, and pasta dishes. It's also a good idea to check food labels for sodium content. Would you like more information on this?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "Great! Some tips for limiting sodium intake include:\n\n1. Preparing meals at home: This gives you more control over the ingredients and amount of salt used.\n2. Swapping out salt: Use herbs, spices, or salt-free seasoning blends to flavour your food instead of salt.\n3. Choose fresh instead of packaged: Fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats generally have less sodium than their canned counterparts.\n4. Read labels: Look for \"low sodium,\" \"reduced sodium,\" or \"no salt added\" on food packaging.\n5. Limit convenience foods: Fast foods, canned soups or frozen dinners often have a high sodium content.\n\nFor phosphorus, foods to eat less of include dairy products, beans, lentils, nuts, and whole grains. These are general guidelines and it may be helpful to speak with a dietitian for more personalized advice.",
        "our_model": "Excellent, Ms. Peck. When you're checking food labels, you'll see the amount of sodium per serving listed. It's important to note the serving size, as some packages contain more than one serving. Also, the label will say if a food is a good source of sodium, meaning it has more than 140 mg per serving, or if it's high in sodium, meaning it has more than 480 mg per serving. Does that make sense so far?"
