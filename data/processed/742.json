    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course, Ms. Peck. In addition to processed foods, some common foods that can be high in sodium include bread, pizza, sandwiches, cold cuts like the tuna in your sandwich, and soups.\n\nPatient: Anything else?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Ms. Peck. Besides processed foods, some common foods that can be high in sodium include bread, pizza, sandwiches, cold cuts and cured meats, soups, fast foods, and pasta dishes. It's also a good idea to check food labels for sodium content. Would you like more information on this?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Ms. Peck. When you're checking food labels, you'll see the amount of sodium per serving listed. It's important to note the serving size, as some packages contain more than one serving. Also, the label will say if a food is a good source of sodium, meaning it has more than 140 mg per serving, or if it's high in sodium, meaning it has more than 480 mg per serving. Does that make sense so far?\n\nPatient: Not really. I can't keep up\n\nNurse: I'm sorry if I was going too fast, Ms. Peck. Let's simplify it. When you look at a food\n\nPatient: with what you're saying there.",

        "gpt4": "I'm sorry if that was a bit overwhelming, Ms. Peck. To simplify, try choosing fresh foods over processed ones, use herbs and spices instead of salt to season your food, and when you do buy packaged foods, aim to choose items with less sodium. Do you think these tips would be manageable for you?",
        "our_model": "I apologize if I was speaking too quickly, Ms. Peck. Let's break it down. When you look at a food label, it will tell you how much sodium is in each serving. The label will also say if there's a lot of sodium in the food. If there's 140 mg or more of sodium in a serving, it's a good source of sodium. If there's 480 mg or more of sodium in a serving, it's high in sodium. Does that help clarify things?"
