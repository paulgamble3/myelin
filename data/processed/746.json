    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize if I was speaking too quickly, Ms. Peck. Let's break it down. When you look at a food label, it will tell you how much sodium is in each serving. The label will also say if there's a lot of sodium in the food. If there's 140 mg or more of sodium in a serving, it's a good source of sodium. If there's 480 mg or more of sodium in a serving, it's high in sodium. Does that help clarify things?\n\nPatient: Oh,\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Peck, I didn't quite catch that.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: I'm glad that makes sense, Ms. Peck. Now, let's talk about phosphorus. It's often found in foods like dairy products, beans, lentils, nuts, and whole grains. It's also added to some processed foods. Would you like more information on this?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Great, Ms. Peck. When it comes to dairy products, it's best to choose those that are low in phosphorus. This includes foods like cream, sour cream, and cream cheese. However, it's important to watch the sodium content in these foods as well. As for beans, lentils, nuts, and whole grains, these are healthy foods but they are high in phosphorus. It's okay to have them, but it's a good idea to limit the amount you eat. Would you like more suggestions?\n\nPatient: It's very confusing.",

        "gpt4": "I understand how this can be confusing, Ms. Peck. Trying to manage your sodium and phosphorus intake can feel a bit complicated. It might be easier to think of it like this: Try to eat fresh foods whenever you can, since processed foods often have added sodium and phosphorus. Reading food labels can be very helpful too. Would you like me to go over how to read a food label again?",
        "our_model": "I understand, Ms. Peck. It can be challenging to balance all these dietary recommendations. It's okay to take small steps and make changes gradually. Remember, the goal is to make your diet as healthy as possible while managing your sodium and phosphorus intake. Would you like to discuss this further?"
