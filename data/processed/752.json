    "prompt": "Nurse: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Peck. We can always continue this discussion at another time. Now, let's talk about your exercise routine. Could you tell me what you've been doing for physical activity?\n\nPatient: Well, I haven't been doing that much. I mean,\n\nNurse: I understand, Ms. Peck. It's okay to start slow. Could you tell me a bit more about what you're currently able to do?\n\nPatient: I don't have a lot of energy.\n\nNurse: I understand, Ms. Peck. It's essential to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. However, regular physical activity can help manage your conditions. Would it be okay if I shared some gentle exercise recommendations with you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: Wonderful, Ms. Peck. Walking is a wonderful low-impact exercise that can be very beneficial. Even a short walk around your home or yard can make a difference. If you're up to it, you could try to gradually increase the length of your walks. Always listen to your body and rest if you need to. Would you like more suggestions?\n\nPatient: No.",
