Could you please repeat what you said about having Stage IV Chronic Kidney Disease?\n\nPatient: I've been hearing about sodium for years.\n\nNurse: I understand, Ms. Aguirre. Managing sodium intake is indeed a key part of managing kidney disease. It's great that you're aware of this. Would you be willing to continue focusing on this, especially considering your slightly elevated blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Excellent, Ms. Aguirre. Another suggestion is to increase your intake of fruits and vegetables, which can help lower blood pressure. Do you think you could incorporate more fruits and vegetables into your diet?\n\nPatient: Well, I probably could. What kinds of fruits and vegetables",
