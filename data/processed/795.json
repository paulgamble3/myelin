    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, Ms. Aguirre. Some fruits and vegetables that are generally considered good for both blood pressure and kidney health include apples, berries, cherries, and leafy green vegetables like spinach and kale. These are all low in sodium and potassium. However, it's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or a dietitian for personalized advice. Does this information help?\n\nPatient: Suggestions that are not confusing, like, what you just\n\nNurse: I\n\nPatient: said.\n\nNurse: apologize if I apologize if my previous explanation was confusing, Ms. Aguirre. Let me simplify it. Fruits like apples, berries, and peaches are generally lower in potassium and can be a good choice for your diet. Similarly, vegetables like cabbage, green beans, and lettuce are also lower in potassium. Would this information be helpful for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's much more helpful.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Aguirre. It's important to remember that everyone's dietary needs are unique, especially when managing conditions like CKD and diabetes. It's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or a dietitian for personalized advice. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: Well, were they normal?",

        "gpt4": "I understand you're curious about your lab results, Ms. Aguirre. You had a few different tests, so let's go over them together. Two tests that might stand out to you are BUN and Creatinine. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen, a waste product your body produces. Your BUN level was 6.17 mmol/L, which is within the normal range. However, your Creatinine level was 2.0 mg/dL, which is slightly higher than normal. This could be related to your kidney condition. Another test you had measures GFR, which stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. This tells us how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. Your GFR was 28 mL/min/1.73m2, indicating Stage IV kidney disease. Lastly, your Urine Albumin was 65 mg/g, indicating there's a bit of protein leaking into your urine, which can also be a sign of kidney disease. This is all a bit technical, so please let me know if anything is unclear or if you have any questions about these results.",
        "our_model": "Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is 6.17 mmol/L, and your creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL, both of which are within normal limits. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 28 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are not filtering as well as they should be, as expected with Stage IV CKD. Your urine albumin is 65 mg/g, which is higher than normal, indicating some kidney damage. Do you have any specific questions about these results, Ms. Aguirre?"
