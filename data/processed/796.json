    "prompt": "Nurse: I\n\nPatient: said.\n\nNurse: apologize if I apologize if my previous explanation was confusing, Ms. Aguirre. Let me simplify it. Fruits like apples, berries, and peaches are generally lower in potassium and can be a good choice for your diet. Similarly, vegetables like cabbage, green beans, and lettuce are also lower in potassium. Would this information be helpful for you?\n\nPatient: Yes. That's much more helpful.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Aguirre. It's important to remember that everyone's dietary needs are unique, especially when managing conditions like CKD and diabetes. It's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or a dietitian for personalized advice. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: Well, were they normal?\n\nNurse: Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is 6.17 mmol/L, and your creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL, both of which are within normal limits. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 28 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are not filtering as well as they should be, as expected with Stage IV CKD. Your urine albumin is 65 mg/g, which is higher than normal, indicating some kidney damage. Do you have any specific questions about these results, Ms. Aguirre?\n\nPatient: Okay.",

        "gpt4": "I'm glad that information was clear for you, Ms. Aguirre. Let's move on to your medications. I see in your record that you're currently prescribed Metformin 500 mg once a day, Tylenol 500 mg three times a day as needed, and Atorvastatin 40 mg daily. Are you taking these medications as instructed?",
        "our_model": "range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is 6.17 mmol/L, and your creatinine is 2.0 mg/dL. Both of these are a bit higher than normal, which is typical in CKD. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 28 mL/min/1.73m2, indicating that your kidneys are not filtering as effectively as they should be. Lastly, your urine albumin is 65 mg/g, which is also higher than normal. This can be a sign of kidney damage. I hope this helps clarify your results. Do you have any other questions about these lab results, Ms. Aguirre?"
