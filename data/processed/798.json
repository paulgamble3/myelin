It's always a good idea to consult with your doctor or a dietitian for personalized advice. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: Well, were they normal?\n\nNurse: Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range.
