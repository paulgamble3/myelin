Dialysis is a treatment usually considered when kidney function is significantly impaired. It's critical to manage your conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, to help maintain your kidney function. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and taking your medications as prescribed can all contribute to this. Would you like some suggestions on how to maintain a healthy lifestyle to support your kidney health?\n\nPatient: But just in case I have to because of my CKD,\n\nNurse: I understand your concerns, Mr. Oliver.

Managing your health conditions and following your doctor's advice can help slow the progression of CKD. Would you like me to provide some tips on how to manage your CKD?\n\nPatient: Ysis.
