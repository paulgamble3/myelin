        "gpt4": "Indeed, Mr. Oliver, store-bought dressings such as Wishbone Italian can contain added sodium. One way to limit the amount of sodium you're consuming is to use these dressings sparingly. A small amount can go a long way in terms of flavor. Alternatively, you might consider making a homemade dressing with olive oil, vinegar, and spices for a lower sodium option. Would you be interested in trying this?",

One suggestion could be to make your own salad dressing at home using olive oil, vinegar, and herbs. This can help you control the amount of sodium in your dressing.
