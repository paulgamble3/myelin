    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, Mr. Wiggins. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, please feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Wiggins. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Wiggins. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was?\n\nPatient: One hundred and twenty eight.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Wiggins. Your blood sugar is a bit higher than the target range. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.",

        "gpt4": "One way to help manage blood sugar levels is to eat a balanced diet. This includes foods like vegetables, lean proteins, fruits and whole grains. Try to limit foods and drinks with added sugars and unhealthy fats. Regular exercise can also help to control your blood sugar levels.\n\nIt's also recommended that you check your blood sugar levels at the same time every day and record your results. This can help your doctor see how your levels change over time and adjust your treatment plan if needed.\n\nRemember to take any medicines your doctor has prescribed and to follow up regularly with them to discuss your progress.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Do you have any questions about this?",
        "our_model": "I apologize for the confusion earlier, Mr. Wiggins. You mentioned that your last blood sugar reading was 128. Just to confirm, is your blood sugar usually higher or lower than this reading?"
