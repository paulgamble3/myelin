    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Wiggins. Your blood sugar is a bit higher than the target range. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels?\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Mr. Wiggins. You mentioned that your last blood sugar reading was 128. Just to confirm, is your blood sugar usually higher or lower than this reading?\n\nPatient: I don't know.\n\nNurse: Give me a moment to check how I can best support you. Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Thank you for your patience, Mr. Wiggins. It's essential to keep your blood sugar levels under control. One strategy is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks that contain a mix of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Do you think this is something you could try?\n\nPatient: Yes.",

Remember to also stay physically active and take your prescribed medications regularly. Please let your healthcare provider know if you have any questions or concerns throughout this process.

Is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?",
