Just to confirm, is your blood sugar usually higher or lower than this reading?\n\nPatient: I don't know.\n\nNurse: Give me a moment to check how I can best support you. Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Thank you for your patience, Mr. Wiggins. It's essential to keep your blood sugar levels under control. One strategy is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks that contain a mix of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Do you think this is something you could try?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Wiggins. Another strategy is to engage in regular physical activity. This could be as simple as a daily walk. Do you think you could incorporate some form of physical activity into your routine?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I walk sometimes.",
