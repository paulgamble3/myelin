    "prompt": "Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Wiggins. Another strategy is to engage in regular physical activity. This could be as simple as a daily walk. Do you think you could incorporate some form of physical activity into your routine?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I walk sometimes.\n\nNurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Wiggins. Walking is a great form of exercise that can help manage your blood sugar levels. Now, let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was?\n\nPatient: Yeah. It was a morning, and it was about a hundred over eighty.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Wiggins. Your blood pressure reading is within the acceptable range, which is good news. It's critical to keep monitoring it regularly. If it's not too much trouble, could you share why you haven't taken your blood pressure in the last day?\n\nPatient: Oh, I have. It was this morning.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Mr. Wiggins. You mentioned that you took your blood pressure this morning and it was around 100 over 80. That's a good reading. It's critical to keep monitoring it regularly. Do you have any questions about managing your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: I have. It was this morning.",
