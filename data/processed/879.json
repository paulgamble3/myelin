    "prompt": "Patient: No. I'm okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, Mr. Wiggins. If you ever have any questions or need more information, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What does the potassium and sodium mean?\n\nPatient: And do I need to get dialysis from my lab?\n\nNurse: Great questions, Mr. Wiggins. Sodium and potassium are minerals that are necessary for your body to function properly. Sodium helps control your body's fluid balance and potassium helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, work properly. Your sodium level is 137 mEq/L and your potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, which are within the normal ranges. As for dialysis, it's typically not needed until kidney function, measured by GFR, drops to a very low level or if symptoms of kidney disease become unmanageable. Your GFR is currently 61 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are still functioning at a reasonable level. Does this help clarify things for you?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Wiggins. If you have any other questions about your lab results, feel free to ask. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently prescribed Metformin 500 mg once a day and Tylenol 500 mg, up to 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
