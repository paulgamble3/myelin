    "prompt": "Nurse: I can imagine that it might feel overwhelming with all the preparation involved. It's quite a process to go through, especially for a preventative screening like this. How are you coping with these feelings?\n\nPatient: What a great question? How am I coping? I don't know. I I don't know. I I gosh.\n\nNurse: It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed.\n\nPatient: I do not have an answer. For you.\n\nNurse: That's okay. It's completely normal to feel this way. I'm here to help you through this process. Before we begin, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Not really. No. I just you know, I didn't realize that I have to wake up in the middle of the night to take the new light only I just really, really don't understand why I yet need to take the full second dose\n\nNurse: I see, it's not uncommon to have questions about the preparation process. The second dose of the bowel prep solution is typically required to ensure that your colon is completely clean for the procedure. This allows Doctor Bailey to get the most accurate results. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy to clarify this and other aspects?\n\nPatient: okay.",

        "gpt4": "Great! Let's start with the 'Clear Liquid Diet'. On the day before your test, you'll be on a clear liquid diet. This means you can only consume liquids you can see through. Examples are clear broths, black coffee, tea without milk, clear fruit juices, water and sports drinks. Note also, red and purple colored liquids should be avoided as they can stain the colon and might be confused for blood during the test.\n\nNow, about the 'Bowel Preparation': You'll take a bowel cleaning medicine called 'NuLytely' the night before and the morning of your procedure. This cleans out your colon so that it can be thoroughly examined. \n\nDoes this help clarify why the second dose is necessary?",
        "our_model": "Great, thank you. I'm here today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll go over the preparation process, what to expect during the procedure, and any post-procedure care. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the preparation. You mentioned earlier about taking the second dose of the bowel prep solution. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?"
