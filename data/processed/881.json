    "prompt": "Patient: Yes.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Wiggins. If you have any other questions about your lab results, feel free to ask. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently prescribed Metformin 500 mg once a day and Tylenol 500 mg, up to 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nNurse: That's excellent, Mr. Wiggins. Sticking to your medication schedule is crucial for managing your conditions. Just to confirm, you're taking Metformin 500 mg once a day and Tylenol 500 mg, up to 1000 mg three times a day as needed, correct?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Mr. Wiggins. You're correct, your Tylenol dosage is 1000 mg three times a day as needed, not 500 mg up to 1000 mg three times a day. I'm glad to hear you're taking your medications as prescribed. It's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No.",

        "gpt4": "That's great to hear, Mr. Wiggins. However, I wanted to clarify a detail regarding your Tylenol dosage. Each Tylenol tablet contains 500 mg. So, to get the correct dose of 1000 mg, you should take two tablets. It's not 1000 mg per tablet, but 1000 mg per dose. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused. Do you have any questions about this?",
