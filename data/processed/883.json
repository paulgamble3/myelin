You're correct, your Tylenol dosage is 1000 mg three times a day as needed, not 500 mg up to 1000 mg three times a day. I'm glad to hear you're taking your medications as prescribed. It's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medication on time?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Mr. Wiggins. The correct dosage for your Tylenol is 500 mg per tablet. You should take two tablets to make up the 1000 mg dose three times a day as needed.
