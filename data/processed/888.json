    "prompt": "Nurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Mr. Wiggins. You're correct, you're a vegan and you eat a low-sodium diet. Could you please share some examples of meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: Stage two CKD patients.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Wiggins. Being a vegan can be a healthy lifestyle choice. Could you share some specific meals you've had recently that align with your dietary needs?\n\nPatient: Do you have any recommendations?\n\nNurse: Absolutely, Mr. Wiggins. As a vegan with Stage II CKD, it's important to control your carbohydrate and sodium intake. A typical meal could include a salad with a variety of vegetables, chickpeas, and a low-sodium dressing. For breakfast, you could have oatmeal with fresh fruit and a sprinkle of cinnamon. For snacks, raw vegetables or a handful of unsalted nuts can be a good choice. Would you like more suggestions or does this give you a good starting point?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad you found the suggestions helpful, Mr. Wiggins. Remember, it's all about balance and moderation. If you ever have any questions about your diet or need more suggestions, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's discuss your back surgeries. How has your recovery been going?\n\nPatient: Fine.",
