    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Wiggins. As a vegan with Stage II CKD, it's important to control your carbohydrate and sodium intake. A typical meal could include a salad with a variety of vegetables, chickpeas, and a low-sodium dressing. For breakfast, you could have oatmeal with fresh fruit and a sprinkle of cinnamon. For snacks, raw vegetables or a handful of unsalted nuts can be a good choice. Would you like more suggestions or does this give you a good starting point?\n\nPatient: Yeah. That's good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad you found the suggestions helpful, Mr. Wiggins. Remember, it's all about balance and moderation. If you ever have any questions about your diet or need more suggestions, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's discuss your back surgeries. How has your recovery been going?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Wiggins. It's critical to continue with any physical therapy or exercises recommended by your doctor to aid in your recovery. If you ever experience any new or worsening pain, please let your doctor know. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices?\n\nPatient: Yes. It smoked cigarettes.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Wiggins. I know it's not easy to talk about. Have you ever considered quitting smoking?\n\nPatient: I'm not really interested in quoting.",
