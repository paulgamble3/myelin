Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices?\n\nPatient: Yes. It smoked cigarettes.\n\nNurse: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Wiggins. I know it's not easy to talk about. Have you ever considered quitting smoking?\n\nPatient: I'm not really interested in quoting.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Wiggins. It's a big decision to make. Could you share why you're not interested in quitting at this time?\n\nPatient: Just not ready. It's too hard. I don't wanna deal with it.\n\nNurse: I can see how you might feel that way, Mr. Wiggins. It's a big change and it's not easy.
