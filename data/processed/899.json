Thank you for asking.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling at home. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week?\n\nPatient: I'm really looking forward to hanging out with you and my friend.\n\nNurse: That sounds like a wonderful plan. What activities do you usually enjoy doing with your friend?\n\nPatient: We love to go see the movies.\n\nNurse: That's great! Watching movies is a wonderful way to relax and enjoy some time off. Do you have a favorite genre or a movie you're planning to see?\n\nPatient: I really like anything that like, dramatic. But I also really like to laugh, so a good comedy has never heard.",
