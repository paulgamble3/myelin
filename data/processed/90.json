    "prompt": "Nurse: That's okay. It's completely normal to feel this way. I'm here to help you through this process. Before we begin, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: Not really. No. I just you know, I didn't realize that I have to wake up in the middle of the night to take the new light only I just really, really don't understand why I yet need to take the full second dose\n\nNurse: I see, it's not uncommon to have questions about the preparation process. The second dose of the bowel prep solution is typically required to ensure that your colon is completely clean for the procedure. This allows Doctor Bailey to get the most accurate results. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy to clarify this and other aspects?\n\nPatient: okay.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. I'm here today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll go over the preparation process, what to expect during the procedure, and any post-procedure care. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the preparation. You mentioned earlier about taking the second dose of the bowel prep solution. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?\n\nPatient: Well, Yeah. As I mentioned, I I just don't understand. Why I have to wake up in the middle of tonight to take it, why don't you guys have a better solution? I just don't understand. Why you have to terrorize your patients like this. Crazy, man.\n\nNurse: I can see why you might feel that way. The reason for taking the second dose in the middle of the night is to ensure that your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure.\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]",

If it's alright with you, let's move on to getting all the logistics out of the way. Is that okay?",
