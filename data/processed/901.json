    "prompt": "Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful plan. What activities do you usually enjoy doing with your friend?\n\nPatient: We love to go see the movies.\n\nNurse: That's great! Watching movies is a wonderful way to relax and enjoy some time off. Do you have a favorite genre or a movie you're planning to see?\n\nPatient: I really like anything that like, dramatic. But I also really like to laugh, so a good comedy has never heard.\n\nNurse: It sounds like you have a great balance of interests. Laughter and drama can both be very therapeutic. Before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, I wanted to ask if there are any symptoms or health concerns you've been experiencing lately that you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, please feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now?\n\nPatient: Sure.",
