    "prompt": "Nurse: Yes, I'm here. You were saying you had a question about managing blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Hi. It's just a medical question since you opened the floor. Can I take time off the thing really\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: Can I take Tylenol for pain relief?\n\nNurse: Yes, you can take Tylenol for pain relief. It's one of your prescribed medications and it's safe to use for managing pain. Just remember to take it as directed by your doctor. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: It does. Thank you very much.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Where are those",

        "gpt4": "Sure, let's go over them. The Sodium (Na) in your body helps control fluids and helps nerves and muscles work correctly. Your level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. \n\nPotassium (K) affects the function of your nerves and muscles, including your heart. Your level is 4.5 mEq/L, which is also within normal limits. \n\nBUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) is a waste product that your kidneys normally filter out. Your BUN level is 6.17 mmol/L. This value is a bit higher than what we want to see, which could be due to your kidney disease. \n\nYour Creatinine level, another waste product filtered by your kidneys, is 2.0 mg/dL - that's also a bit higher which again could be related to your kidney disease. \n\nThe 'GFR' or Glomerular Filtration Rate is a measure of your kidney function. Your GFR is 28 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates stage 4 chronic kidney disease. \n\nLastly, urine albumin 65 mg/g is a bit high, which may signal some damage to your kidneys. \n\nThese results help your doctor understand how well your kidneys",
        "our_model": "I see that you had your sodium, potassium, BUN, creatinine, GFR, and urine albumin levels checked. Your sodium level was 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level was 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, was 6.17 mmol/L, which is a bit high. This test measures the amount of urea nitrogen, a waste product, in your blood. Your creatinine level was 2.0 mg/dL, which is also a bit high. This test measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, was 28 mL/min/1.73m2. This test measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste. A lower GFR can indicate kidney disease. Lastly, your urine albumin was 65 mg/g, which is high. This test measures the amount of albumin, a protein, in your urine. A high level can indicate kidney damage. Do you have any questions about these results?"
