    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: Can I take Tylenol for pain relief?\n\nNurse: Yes, you can take Tylenol for pain relief. It's one of your prescribed medications and it's safe to use for managing pain. Just remember to take it as directed by your doctor. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: It does. Thank you very much.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Where are those\n\nNurse: I see that you had your sodium, potassium, BUN, creatinine, GFR, and urine albumin levels checked. Your sodium level was 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level was 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, was 6.17 mmol/L, which is a bit high. This test measures the amount of urea nitrogen, a waste product, in your blood. Your creatinine level was 2.0 mg/dL, which is also a bit high. This test measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, was 28 mL/min/1.73m2. This test measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste. A lower GFR can indicate kidney disease. Lastly, your urine albumin was 65 mg/g, which is high. This test measures the amount of albumin, a protein, in your urine. A high level can indicate kidney damage. Do you have any questions about these results?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What does potassium and sodium mean?",

        "gpt4": "Sodium and potassium are both types of electrolytes, or substances found in your body fluids. They each play several important roles. Sodium helps regulate the amount of water in your body and is important for nerve and muscle function. Potassium helps maintain the balance of fluid in the body, keeps your heart beating regularly, and helps muscles to contract. The right balance of these electrolytes is necessary for your body to function properly. Does that help clarify?",
        "our_model": "Sodium is a mineral that your body needs to function properly. It helps control your body's fluid balance and helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Potassium is another mineral that's crucial for heart function and muscle contraction. Both of these minerals are found in many foods, and they're also in your blood. When your doctor orders a blood test, they can measure the levels of these minerals to see if they're in a healthy range. Does that help clarify things?"
