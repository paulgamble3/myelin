    "prompt": "Nurse: Great, thank you. I'm here today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll go over the preparation process, what to expect during the procedure, and any post-procedure care. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the preparation. You mentioned earlier about taking the second dose of the bowel prep solution. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this?\n\nPatient: Well, Yeah. As I mentioned, I I just don't understand. Why I have to wake up in the middle of tonight to take it, why don't you guys have a better solution? I just don't understand. Why you have to terrorize your patients like this. Crazy, man.\n\nNurse: I can see why you might feel that way. The reason for taking the second dose in the middle of the night is to ensure that your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure.\n\nPatient: [NO RESPONSE]\n\nNurse: I can see why you might feel that way. The reason for taking the second dose in the middle of the night is to ensure that your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure.\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nNurse: I'm here. I understand your concerns. The timing of the second dose is designed to ensure your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. This helps Doctor Bailey get the most accurate results. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Let's move on to the logistics of your appointment. Your colonoscopy is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you?\n\nPatient: Gosh. You guys really require so much time for everything.",

        "gpt4": "I realize it might seem like a considerable amount of time, but getting there an hour early helps ensure everything is ready for your procedure. It will give your care team ample time to check you in, review your health information, and answer any last-minute questions. Is that acceptable to you?",
        "our_model": "I understand it might feel like a lot of time, but it's necessary to ensure everything goes smoothly. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you?"
