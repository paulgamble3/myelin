I want to acknowledge that it's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time?\n\nPatient: No. I'm pretty good in my routine.\n\nNurse: That's fantastic. Sticking to your medication routine is crucial for managing your health conditions. Just a reminder, there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for patients with chronic kidney disease to take. Always talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What kind of medications are not pay\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: What kind of medications are not saved?\n\nNurse: Certain medications can be harmful to your kidneys or may not be effectively filtered by your kidneys when they're not functioning at their best. These can include some pain medications, like ibuprofen and naproxen, some antibiotics, and certain medications used to treat heartburn and acid reflux.
