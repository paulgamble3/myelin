He's a lot of good fish is.\n\nNurse: It sounds like you're making thoughtful choices about your diet, which is excellent. Soups and broths can be a good source of nutrients, but as you mentioned, they can also be high in sodium. Choosing low-sodium options and incorporating fish, which is a good source of protein and healthy fats, are great steps towards managing your health. Do you have any questions about your diet or would you like any suggestions?\n\nPatient: Yeah. I would love some suggestions of what foods that can eat on such a restrictive diet.\n\nNurse: Absolutely, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions. For your carbohydrate-controlled diet, foods like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are good choices. They're high in fiber and can help control your blood sugar levels. For your renal diet, it's important to limit foods high in phosphorus and potassium. This includes foods like dairy products, beans, and certain fruits and vegetables. For your sodium-limited diet, try to avoid processed foods, which often contain high amounts of sodium. Instead, try to cook at home as much as possible, so you can control the amount of salt in your food. Does this help?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. I'm glad I could provide some helpful suggestions. Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized advice. Now, let's discuss your back surgeries. How has your recovery been going?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling good.",
