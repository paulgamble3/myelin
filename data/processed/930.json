    "prompt": "Nurse: Absolutely, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions. For your carbohydrate-controlled diet, foods like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are good choices. They're high in fiber and can help control your blood sugar levels. For your renal diet, it's important to limit foods high in phosphorus and potassium. This includes foods like dairy products, beans, and certain fruits and vegetables. For your sodium-limited diet, try to avoid processed foods, which often contain high amounts of sodium. Instead, try to cook at home as much as possible, so you can control the amount of salt in your food. Does this help?\n\nPatient: Yes. It does. Thank you.\n\nNurse: You're welcome. I'm glad I could provide some helpful suggestions. Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized advice. Now, let's discuss your back surgeries. How has your recovery been going?\n\nPatient: I'm feeling good.\n\nNurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling good after your back surgeries. It's critical to continue with any physical therapy or exercises recommended by your doctor to maintain your progress. Do you have any concerns or questions about your recovery?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you have any questions or concerns at any point, please feel free to bring them up. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices?\n\nPatient: I do.
