    "prompt": "Nurse: Alright, if you have any questions or concerns at any point, please feel free to bring them up. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices?\n\nPatient: I do. I do smoke a pack of cigarettes a day And I should tell you that I am not ready to quit.\n\nNurse: I appreciate your honesty. It's a big step to even consider quitting smoking. Can you share why you feel you're not ready to quit at this time?\n\nPatient: Well, Just don't see the points. I'm already old, and I'm setting my ways.\n\nNurse: I see. It's completely normal to feel this way. Change can be challenging, especially when it involves a habit that's been part of our lives for a long time. If you ever decide to quit, we have a lot of resources that could help you. Would you like me to share some of these resources with you, just in case you decide to quit in the future?\n\nPatient: Not at this time.\n\nNurse: That's perfectly fine. If you ever change your mind, please don't hesitate to ask. Remember, it's never too late to quit smoking. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.",
