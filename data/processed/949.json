    "prompt": "Nurse: Thank you for sharing that information. It's important to monitor your blood pressure regularly, especially given your conditions. May I share some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure?\n\nPatient: Fine.\n\nNurse: Great, thank you. One way to manage blood pressure is by reducing salt intake. This can be achieved by eating fresh foods and avoiding processed ones, which often contain high amounts of salt. Also, regular physical activity can help lower blood pressure. It's recommended to aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate activity, like brisk walking, most days of the week. Do you think these are changes you could incorporate into your routine?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nNurse: Another strategy is regular physical activity. This doesn't have to be strenuous; even a walk around the block can help. Would you be open to incorporating more physical activity into your routine?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's okay. It's essential to do what feels comfortable for you. Let's move on to discussing your recent lab results. Do you have any questions about them?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What happened?",

        "gpt4": "Your recent labs showed that your Sodium (Na) level was 143 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Similarly, your Potassium (K) level was also normal at 3.9 mEq/L. The BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, which measures the amount of nitrogen in your blood that comes from the waste product urea, was 5.19 mmol/L. This is also within normal limits. Your Creatinine, a waste product produced by muscles, was 1.1 mg/dL, which is marginally elevated. Engagement in strenuous activities can cause this level to rise. Additionally, your Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) was 75 mL/min/1.73m2. The GFR gives an estimation of how well your kidneys are filtering waste. A result of 60 or above is normal and yours is above that. Finally, the Urine Albumin was 134 mg/g, which shows some protein in your urine. Ideally, this should be less but this level is common in early stages of CKD. Does this clarify your query or do you have more questions about your labs?",
        "our_model": "I see that your recent lab results show some changes. For example, your sodium level is 143 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 3.9 mEq/L, which is also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is 5.19 mmol/L, which is a measure of how well your kidneys are working. Your creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, which is a waste product that your kidneys filter out of your blood. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 75 mL/min/1.73m2, which tells us how well your kidneys are filtering waste. Lastly, your urine albumin is 134 mg/g, which is a bit high. This could indicate some kidney damage. Do you have any specific questions about these results?"
