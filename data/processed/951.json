    "prompt": "Nurse: Another strategy is regular physical activity. This doesn't have to be strenuous; even a walk around the block can help. Would you be open to incorporating more physical activity into your routine?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nNurse: That's okay. It's essential to do what feels comfortable for you. Let's move on to discussing your recent lab results. Do you have any questions about them?\n\nPatient: Yeah. What happened?\n\nNurse: I see that your recent lab results show some changes. For example, your sodium level is 143 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 3.9 mEq/L, which is also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is 5.19 mmol/L, which is a measure of how well your kidneys are working. Your creatinine level is 1.1 mg/dL, which is a waste product that your kidneys filter out of your blood. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 75 mL/min/1.73m2, which tells us how well your kidneys are filtering waste. Lastly, your urine albumin is 134 mg/g, which is a bit high. This could indicate some kidney damage. Do you have any specific questions about these results?\n\nPatient: Look, lady. I don't understand half the word of what you just told me. What the heck is the b u n and creatinine? What does it even mean?\n\nNurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear. BUN stands for Blood Urea Nitrogen. It's a waste product that's produced in your body and is usually filtered out by your kidneys. Creatinine is another waste product that your kidneys filter out of your blood. When these levels are high, it can indicate that your kidneys aren't working as well as they should be. Does that help clarify things a bit?\n\nPatient: What do you mean by high? What numbers are high?",

        "gpt4": "I'm sorry for any confusion. To clarify, normal blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels are generally around 7 to 20 mg/dL for adults, and normal creatinine levels are usually between 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL for women and 0.7 to 1.3 mg/dL for men. So, any number significantly above these ranges may be considered high and could potentially signal an issue with kidney function. However, these values can also be influenced by other factors like dehydration and certain medications. It's important to discuss your results with your doctor to get a complete understanding of your individual situation.",
        "our_model": "For BUN, a normal level is typically between 7 and 20 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Your level is 5.19 mmol/L, which is within the normal range. For creatinine, a normal level is usually between 0.6 and 1.2 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) in adult males. Your level is 1.1 mg/dL, which is also within the normal range. These levels suggest that your kidneys are functioning well at this time. Does that make sense?"
