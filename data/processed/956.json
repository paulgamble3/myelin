I hope that's clearer. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently prescribed Amlodipine 5 mg oral tablet with a dosage of 10 mg daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's great to hear. Now, let's move on to your next medication, Ferrous sulfate 45 mg oral tablet. The prescribed dosage is 45 mg three times a day. Have you been taking this medication as directed?\n\nPatient: Uh-huh.\n\nNurse: That's good to hear. Lastly, you're also prescribed Renvela 400 mg oral tablet, with a dosage of 800 mg three times a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: That's excellent. It's critical to take your medications as prescribed to manage your conditions effectively. Now, I'd like to talk about your diet. Can you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently?\n\nPatient: I hate my new diet. I'm on a dash diet and a low salt diet. I don't even know what to eat because all these stupid rules, and I don't wanna screw up my kidneys ferrous. So what do I do?",
