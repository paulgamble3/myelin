Those will kill you.\n\nNurse: That's a very healthy stance. It's great to hear that you don't smoke. Now, I'd like to ask if you have any questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss. Is there anything on your mind?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Of course. What's on your mind?\n\nPatient: I tried to pee in a couple of times, but you're an albumin test.",
