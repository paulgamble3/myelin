    "prompt": "Nurse: That's a very healthy stance. It's great to hear that you don't smoke. Now, I'd like to ask if you have any questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss. Is there anything on your mind?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Of course. What's on your mind?\n\nPatient: I tried to pee in a couple of times, but you're an albumin test.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: Why?\n\nNurse: That's a great question. The urine albumin test measures the amount of albumin in your urine. Albumin is a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. A high level of albumin in the urine can be a sign of kidney disease. That's why it's important to monitor this. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yeah.",
