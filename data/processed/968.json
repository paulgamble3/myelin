    "prompt": "Nurse: Of course. What's on your mind?\n\nPatient: I tried to pee in a couple of times, but you're an albumin test.\n\nNurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question?\n\nPatient: Why?\n\nNurse: That's a great question. The urine albumin test measures the amount of albumin in your urine. Albumin is a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. A high level of albumin in the urine can be a sign of kidney disease. That's why it's important to monitor this. Does that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, to summarize, you've agreed to continue taking your medications as prescribed, to monitor your blood sugar levels, and to consider some suggestions for managing your diet. Can I count on you to do these things?\n\nPatient: I'm not gonna be happy about it, but I guess.",
