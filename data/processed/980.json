        "gpt4": "There are two main types of dialysis - hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n\nHemodialysis involves filtering your blood outside of your body using a machine. This is commonly done in a dialysis center, but can also be done at home with proper training. Hemodialysis usually takes about three to five hours and is typically done three times a week.\n\nPeritoneal dialysis, on the other hand, involves filtering your blood inside your body. During this process, a cleansing fluid is put into your abdomen through a catheter, and it filters the waste products out of your blood across the peritoneum, which is a membrane in your abdomen. This can be done at home, at work, or while traveling, and is usually done daily.\n\nThe type of dialysis that would be best for you depends on a number of factors including your overall health, lifestyle, personal preference, and so on. Your doctors can provide more detailed information and help guide you in making the decision.",
        "our_model": "Yes, there are two main types of dialysis - hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis uses a machine to filter waste and extra fluid from your blood. It's usually done at a dialysis center, and you typically go a few times a week. Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your abdomen, called the peritoneum, to filter your blood. You can do this at home using a special solution. Would you like me to go into more detail about each type?"
