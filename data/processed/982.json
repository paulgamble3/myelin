    "prompt": "Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said?\n\nPatient: Are there different types of dialysis.\n\nNurse: Yes, there are different types of dialysis. Would you like me to provide some information about them?\n\nPatient: And how do they differ?\n\nNurse: Yes, there are two main types of dialysis - hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Hemodialysis uses a machine to filter waste and extra fluid from your blood. It's usually done at a dialysis center, and you typically go a few times a week. Peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your abdomen, called the peritoneum, to filter your blood. You can do this at home using a special solution. Would you like me to go into more detail about each type?\n\nPatient: No. That's okay.\n\nNurse: Alright, if you have any other questions at any point during our conversation, feel free to ask. Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to go over a few topics to check on how you're doing. Is that alright?\n\nPatient: Yes.",
