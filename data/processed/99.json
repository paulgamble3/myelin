Me,\n\nNurse: I understand that this can feel overwhelming. It's a lot to take in. I'm here to help make this process as smooth as possible for you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to proceed?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nNurse: Great, let's move on to your medications. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications. However, I would like to confirm if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Are you currently taking any of these?\n\nPatient: No.",
