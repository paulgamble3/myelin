[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Paxton Winner? [INST] Patient: It's Paxton. [/INST] Nurse: Hello Paxton, I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Pretty good time to talk. [/INST] Nurse: Great. I'm glad to hear that. How has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: My day's been good. Alright. I'm just really freaking out freaking out about the procedure coming up in two days. I am just really, really, really Gosh. My mind is racing. I don't know where to find piece right now. You know, just really, really I don't know where to begin. I just feel extremely I feel like I'm walking into something that I shouldn't, but then I know that I Jude. And then that gosh. See, like, I'm all over the place, and I don't know what to say. Extremely disoriented. [/INST] Nurse: I can hear that you're feeling a bit overwhelmed. It's completely normal to feel this way before a procedure. You're not alone in this. I'm here to help you through it. Is there anything specific you're worried about that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Just, like, honestly, I'm afraid that knee is not gonna get better. Do you think my team will improve after the surgery? [/INST] Nurse: It's a very common concern. [INST] Patient: Two. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question? [INST] Patient: Do you think the pain my pain will get better after the surgery. [/INST] Nurse: Yes. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve pain and help you regain function in your knee. Most people experience significant pain relief and improved mobility after recovery. It's critical to remember that everyone's recovery is different, but your healthcare team, including Doctor Stevens, will be there to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else you're concerned about? [INST] Patient: No. No and yes. Yes and no. Will I be able to move around after the surgery without pain. [/INST] Nurse: After the surgery, you will likely experience some pain as you heal. However, the pain you feel should be manageable with the medications your doctor will prescribe. Over time, as you recover and go through physical therapy, the pain will decrease and your mobility will improve. It's important to remember that this is a process and it will take some time to fully recover. Would you like to discuss anything else about the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Of course. What else would you like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Yeah. How long is it? [/INST] Nurse: The actual surgery typically takes about 1 to 2 hours. However, the preparation before the surgery and the recovery time immediately after can add a few more hours to your hospital stay on the day of the procedure. After the surgery, you can expect to stay in the hospital for a few days, depending on your progress. Does that help? [INST] Patient: Yes. It helps. So okay. So typically one to two hours. Gotcha. And preparation makes sense. And how long is the recovery [/INST] Nurse: The recovery time varies from person to person, but generally, you can expect to use a walker or crutches for about 6 weeks. After that, you'll likely transition to a cane for a few more weeks. Full recovery can take anywhere from 3 to 6 months, but it's important to remember that everyone's recovery is unique. Your healthcare team will provide you with a more personalized timeline based on your progress. Does that answer your question? [INST] Patient: It does. Yes. [/INST] Nurse: ",
