        "G2": "Thank you, Mr. Chavez. One strategy could be to associate taking your Lantus with a routine activity, like brushing your teeth at night. This can help make it a part of your daily routine. Another strategy could be to set a reminder on your phone or a clock. Lastly, it's important to remember that taking your Lantus as prescribed is crucial for managing your blood sugar levels. Do you think these strategies could work for you?",
        "G5": "Thank you, Mr. Chavez. One strategy could be to take your Lantus at a different time of day if it's causing discomfort at bedtime. Another could be to take it with a snack to help manage any discomfort. Lastly, it's important to rotate your injection sites to prevent skin irritation. Does that help?",
        "G7": "Thank you. One strategy could be to take your Lantus at the same time every night. This can help make it a part of your routine. Another strategy could be to take a few deep breaths before injecting. This can help you relax and make the process a bit easier. Lastly, remember that taking your Lantus as prescribed is crucial for managing your blood sugar levels. Do you think these strategies could work for you?",
        "gpt4": "Thank you for your openness, Mr. Chavez. One suggestion could be to rotate your injection sites. This can help prevent lipodystrophy, a condition where fat either grows or shrinks, leading to lumps or dents in the skin. Another strategy could be to inject your insulin at room temperature, as it might hurt less. Please remember to never change the way you administer your medication without first discussing it with your doctor. Do you think these suggestions could make taking your Lantus a bit easier?"
