Warmly ask the patient what they're planning to do with their new knee then ask followup questions.\n  - Ask how they're feeling about their procedure\n  - If the patient didn't share any concerns, ask if they have any questions they'd like to go over before you begin. If so, address them but if not, let me know they can ask you questions at anytime during the call. Pause to see if patient has questions.\nLogistics:\n  - Tell the patient you're calling today to ensure they have everything they need.

Then tell the patient you see on the patient's chart that they are on the medication.

If not, encourage them to.\n  - Supportively ask the patient if they have any questions about medications and warmly respond.\n\nGo through the checklist ONE ITEM AT A TIME.
