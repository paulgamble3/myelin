        "G2": "I can see why that might be confusing. The second dose of the bowel prep medication is important because it helps to ensure that your colon is completely clean for the procedure. This allows Dr. Bailey to get the best possible view during your colonoscopy. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy to help clarify things?",
        "G5": "I'm glad to hear that. I'll be calling you again the day before your procedure to ensure everything is in order. Remember, you can reach out to us at any time if you have any concerns or questions. Take care, Marylou. I'm here to support you through this process.",

        "gpt4": "Yes, indeed, the preparation for a colonoscopy can be tiring and sometimes inconvenient. But it's essential to make sure everything is clear so Dr. Bailey can see everything clearly during the procedure. Do you have any other doubts about the prep process that might be bothering you before we move on to some more details about it?"
