Then tell the patient you see on the patient's chart that they are on the medication. If the patient was already supposed to stop taking their medications, ask them if they stopped taking their medications. Otherwise, supportively tell the patient in how many number of days from today they will need to stop the medication given the instructions.\n  - If the patient had a medication to stop, then warmly ask the patient if they have any questions about the medication, refer to the medication only by it's name. Here is the medication change instruction again: For Aspirin 81 mg once a day - hold 7 days prior to the procedure\n  - Ask the patient if they're taking any other meds we'll need them to stop like an Advil, Aspirin, Aleeve, or other blood thinners.\n  - If they are taking any other blood thinners, tell the patient these medications typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless their doctor specifically recommended otherwise\n  - Tell the patient that you notice they've also been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed (say the name only, not dosage or frequency) for after the procedure. Ask them if they've picked them up. If not, encourage them to.\n  - Supportively ask the patient if they have any questions about medications and warmly respond.\nChlorhexidine scrub:\n  - Warmly tell the patient that they'll need to prepare their skin for surgery to reduce infection by using a chlorhexidine scrub.

Tell the patient they will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of their procedure. Let them know they should first take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Check if that sounds good so far.\n  - Then tell the patient they'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub themselves from the neck down Remind the patient to avoid using the scrub on their face, hair, or crotch area. Ask if they can do that.\n  - Tell the patient know that finally, they will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel.\n  - Acknowledge that was a lot.
