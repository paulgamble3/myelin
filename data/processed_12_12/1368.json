[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Ana Aguirre? [INST] Patient: Yes. It is. [/INST] Nurse: Hello. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Lynne Contreras, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately? [INST] Patient: I'm feeling quite home. Thank you for asking. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling at home. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? [INST] Patient: I'm really looking forward to hanging out with you and my friend. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful plan. What activities do you usually enjoy doing with your friend? [INST] Patient: We love to go see the movies. [/INST] Nurse: That's great! Watching movies is a wonderful way to relax and enjoy some time off. Do you have a favorite genre or a movie you're planning to see? [INST] Patient: I really like anything that like, dramatic. But I also really like to laugh, so a good comedy has never heard. [/INST] Nurse: It sounds like you have a great balance of interests. Laughter and drama can both be very therapeutic. Before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, I wanted to ask if there are any symptoms or health concerns you've been experiencing lately that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: I don't think so. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, if you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, please feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. And when I last checked yesterday, and it was one twenty eight. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that information. It's great that you're keeping track of your blood sugar levels. However, a reading of 128 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes. Would it be alright if I shared some recommendations on how to manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: Okay. [/INST] Nurse: Would it be alright if I shared some recommendations on how to manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: Hello? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, I'm here. Would it be alright if I shared some recommendations on how to manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you. One strategy is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks that contain a mix of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. Another strategy is regular physical activity, as it can help your body use insulin more effectively. Lastly, it's important to take your medication as prescribed. Do these suggestions make sense to you? [INST] Patient: They do. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's talk about your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was? [INST] Patient: I think yesterday, it was ninety over sixty. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for that information. A blood pressure reading of 90 over 60 is within the normal range, which is good news. It's critical to keep monitoring it regularly. Do you have any questions about managing your blood pressure? [INST] Patient: I was wondering [/INST] Nurse: Yes, please feel free to ask your question. [INST] Patient: Hi. I'm here with blood pressure [/INST] Nurse: Yes, I'm here. You were saying you had a question about managing blood pressure? [INST] Patient: Hi. It's just a medical question since you opened the floor. Can I take time off the thing really [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question? [INST] Patient: Can I take Tylenol for pain relief? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, you can take Tylenol for pain relief. It's one of your prescribed medications and it's safe to use for managing pain. Just remember to take it as directed by your doctor. Does that answer your question? [INST] Patient: It does. Thank you very much. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Where are those [/INST] Nurse: I see that you had your sodium, potassium, BUN, creatinine, GFR, and urine albumin levels checked. Your sodium level was 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level was 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, was 6.17 mmol/L, which is a bit high. This test measures the amount of urea nitrogen, a waste product, in your blood. Your creatinine level was 2.0 mg/dL, which is also a bit high. This test measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, was 28 mL/min/1.73m2. This test measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste. A lower GFR can indicate kidney disease. Lastly, your urine albumin was 65 mg/g, which is high. This test measures the amount of albumin, a protein, in your urine. A high level can indicate kidney damage. Do you have any questions about these results? [INST] Patient: Yeah. What does potassium and sodium mean? [/INST] Nurse: Sodium is a mineral that your body needs to function properly. It helps control your body's fluid balance and helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Potassium is another mineral that's crucial for heart function and muscle contraction. Both of these minerals are found in many foods, and they're also in your blood. When your doctor orders a blood test, they can measure the levels of these minerals to see if they're in a healthy range. Does that help clarify things? [INST] Patient: Yes. It does. And that's why I wanted to ask Well, I need to go in dialysis for any of these results. [/INST] Nurse: Your recent lab results do show some imbalances, but they don't necessarily mean you need to start dialysis. Dialysis is typically considered when kidney function, measured by GFR, drops to a very low level or if symptoms of kidney disease become severe. Your GFR is 28 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates some kidney damage, but it's not at the level where dialysis would typically be considered. However, it's important to continue managing your health conditions and following your doctor's advice to protect your kidney function. Does that answer your question? [INST] Patient: Yes. It does. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome. I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Metformin 500 mg once a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. Taking your medication as prescribed is crucial in managing your conditions. Now, let's move on to the next medication. You're also prescribed Tylenol 500 mg, and the dosage is 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking this medication as directed? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent. It's essential to take your medications as prescribed to manage your pain effectively. Lastly, you're prescribed Atorvastatin 40 mg, and the dosage is one tablet daily. Have you been taking this medication as directed? [INST] Patient: Mhmm. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. Taking your Atorvastatin as prescribed is important for managing your cholesterol levels. I want to acknowledge that it's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time? [INST] Patient: No. I'm pretty good in my routine. [/INST] Nurse: That's fantastic. Sticking to your medication routine is crucial for managing your health conditions. Just a reminder, there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for patients with chronic kidney disease to take. Always talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: Yeah. What kind of medications are not pay [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question? [INST] Patient: What kind of medications are not saved? [/INST] Nurse: Certain medications can be harmful to your kidneys or may not be effectively filtered by your kidneys when they're not functioning at their best. These can include some pain medications, like ibuprofen and naproxen, some antibiotics, and certain medications used to treat heartburn and acid reflux. It's always best to check with your doctor or pharmacist before starting any new medication, even if it's over-the-counter. Does that answer your question? [INST] Patient: It does. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome. I'm glad I could provide the information you needed. Now, let's talk about your diet. Can you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I like to eat a good balanced diet but I am on a Reno low carb low salt diet. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear that you're following a balanced diet. Could you share a bit more about what you typically eat in a day? [INST] Patient: Tried to make sure I sent with some soups and broth. And a separate height \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\nPatient: sodium because I know that means that's high in salt. I tried it. He's a lot of good fish is. [/INST] Nurse: It sounds like you're making thoughtful choices about your diet, which is excellent. Soups and broths can be a good source of nutrients, but as you mentioned, they can also be high in sodium. Choosing low-sodium options and incorporating fish, which is a good source of protein and healthy fats, are great steps towards managing your health. Do you have any questions about your diet or would you like any suggestions? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I would love some suggestions of what foods that can eat on such a restrictive diet. [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions. For your carbohydrate-controlled diet, foods like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables are good choices. They're high in fiber and can help control your blood sugar levels. For your renal diet, it's important to limit foods high in phosphorus and potassium. This includes foods like dairy products, beans, and certain fruits and vegetables. For your sodium-limited diet, try to avoid processed foods, which often contain high amounts of sodium. Instead, try to cook at home as much as possible, so you can control the amount of salt in your food. Does this help? [INST] Patient: Yes. It does. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: ",
