She went to Cornell Medical School and completed her Orthopedic training at Stanford University Hospital.\n\nHere are facts about colonoscopy procedures: Colon cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. Colonoscopies can detect colon cancer in the earliest stages, reduce the risk of colon cancer, improve symptom management, and improve quality of life. For any follow up actions or additional tasks need to be taken for the patient, ONLY tell the patient you will note it down for their care team to review. \n\nDo not ask more than one question at a time.

[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Timoteo Valenzuela? [INST] Patient: Yeah. That's me. [/INST] Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm calling about your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Valenzuela. I hope your day is going well so far. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure? [INST] Patient: I'm doing okay. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. It's completely normal to have some feelings about a procedure like this. Is there anything specific you'd like to discuss or any questions you have before we begin? [INST] Patient: Nope. I don't think so. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it? [INST] Patient: Doing okay. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the answers you're looking for. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy. Is that okay? [INST] Patient: Yep. [/INST] Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your procedure. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Yep. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect, Mr. Valenzuela. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Is there anything else about the logistics that\u2019s worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'm glad to hear that the logistics are clear. Before we move on to talk about your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Are you okay to continue? [INST] Patient: Yep. [/INST] Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your medication in preparation for the colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications we'll need you to stop, like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: No. I'm not. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications or anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, rice, and pasta, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about eating only low fiber foods? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. It's essential to stick to this diet to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Now, I'm curious, what low fiber foods do you enjoy eating? [INST] Patient: I like right. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Valenzuela, could you please repeat that? [INST] Patient: I like rice, [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Valenzuela. Rice is a great choice for a low fiber diet. Do you have a favorite way to prepare it? [INST] Patient: I also was a little bit of hot fast. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Valenzuela, could you please repeat that? [INST] Patient: I like it with hot sauce [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a tasty way to enjoy rice, Mr. Valenzuela. It's a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You will also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications? [INST] Patient: No. I'm not. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Valenzuela. It's essential to stop these supplements and medications to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic? [INST] Patient: Nope. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and PLENVU laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it? [INST] Patient: Not super excited, but Patient: We do what we gotta do. Right? [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Valenzuela. It's not the most enjoyable part, but it's crucial for the procedure. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the prep? [INST] Patient: No. I don't think so. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's critical to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about the clear liquid diet? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your PLENVU laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier? [INST] Patient: Okay. [/INST] Nurse: Great, Mr. Valenzuela. Here are a couple of tips that might make the bowel prep easier for you. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it more palatable. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips? [INST] Patient: Yeah. And it sounds good. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Valenzuela. These tips can make the process a bit more comfortable. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or anything else you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I don't think so. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. The last part of your prep is to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this or anything else you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I don't think so? \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves.
