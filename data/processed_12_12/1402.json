Before we move on, is there anything you've been feeling concerned about health-wise that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now? [INST] Patient: Sure.

This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, and incorporating a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Another strategy is regular physical activity. This doesn't necessarily mean going to the gym, it could be as simple as a daily walk.
