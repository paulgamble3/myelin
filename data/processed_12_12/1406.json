Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens.

[INST] Patient: Yep. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect. After you've turned the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down.

Finally, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember.

Now, I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a few more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Nope. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Let's move on to the next question.
