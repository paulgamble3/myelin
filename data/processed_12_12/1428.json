        "G2": "Alright, Mr. Kageyama. After you've been on the clear liquid diet for 24 hours, you'll need to start taking the GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is a large volume of liquid that will help clean out your colon. You'll need to drink 8 ounces every 10 minutes until the solution is gone. It's important to stay close to a bathroom during this time. Do you have any questions about the GoLYTELY laxative solution?",

        "G7": "Alright. After you've been on a clear liquid diet for 24 hours, you'll start taking the GoLYTELY laxative solution. This solution helps clean out your colon so that your doctor can get the best possible view during your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about the GoLYTELY laxative solution?",
        "gpt4": "Alright, Mr. Kageyama. Once you start your clear liquid diet, later in the day, you will also start drinking the GoLYTELY solution. This is a powerful laxative that cleanses your colon for the colonoscopy. The laxative can cause loose, frequent stools and abdominal cramping. This is normal and means that the prep is working. You will spend a lot of time in the bathroom, so we recommend preparing with flushable wipes and skin-soothing products. Do you have any questions about this?"
