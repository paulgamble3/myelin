It is. [/INST] Nurse: Hello, Mr. Hardy. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Anuj Gopal, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately? [INST] Patient: I'm feeling very calm. Thank you for asking. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling calm, Mr. Hardy. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? [INST] Patient: I'm looking forward to playing with my dog and watching some movies. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a lovely plan, Mr. Hardy. What kind of movies do you enjoy watching? [INST] Patient: Well, given that, it's almost Christmas. I'm really in the holiday. Serious. They wanna watch movies like, home alone. [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Hardy. Home Alone is a classic holiday movie. Do you have a favorite scene or moment from the movie? [INST] Patient: I like when Joe said she had just called on fire. [/INST] Nurse: That's a memorable scene indeed, Mr. Hardy. It's always fun to watch those classic holiday movies. Before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, I wanted to ask if there are any symptoms or health concerns you've been experiencing lately that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I can't think of any. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Hardy. If you do have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, please feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Hardy. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? [INST] Patient: Yep. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent, Mr. Hardy. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was? [INST] Patient: It was a one forty eight. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Hardy. Your blood sugar is a bit higher than the target range. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Hardy. One strategy to help manage your blood sugar levels is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, and incorporating a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Do you feel you're able to incorporate this into your daily routine? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I don't think we're not. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Hardy. Another strategy is regular physical activity. This could be as simple as a daily walk. Do you currently have any physical activities incorporated into your daily routine? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I think my dog almost didn't walk. [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Hardy. Walking your dog is a great way to stay active. Now, let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the result was? [INST] Patient: It was yesterday, and it was one hundred over seventy. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Hardy. Your blood pressure reading is within the acceptable range, which is good news. To help maintain this, it's important to continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and to follow a healthy lifestyle. This includes eating a balanced diet, staying active, and limiting alcohol and caffeine. Are you comfortable with these suggestions? [INST] Patient: I guess I have to be for my health. [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Hardy. These lifestyle changes are indeed crucial for managing your blood pressure and overall health. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Well, I didn't get the results yet. Where are they? [/INST] Nurse: I apologize for any confusion, Mr. Hardy. I have the results here, but the best way to get the most accurate and up-to-date information would be to contact your doctor's office directly. They can provide you with the most recent results and explain them in detail. Is there a specific result you're curious about? [INST] Patient: It's all of them. I know they time you tested for lots of things that did. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Hardy, could you please repeat your question? [INST] Patient: I just wanna know all of the results. [/INST] Nurse: I understand, Mr. Hardy. Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 139 mEq/L, potassium level is 3.6 mEq/L, BUN level is 6.87 mmol/L, creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, GFR is 90 mL/min/1.73m2, and urine albumin level is 82 mg/g. These results are important for monitoring your kidney function and overall health. If you have any specific questions about these results, I'm here to help. [INST] Patient: Yeah. What's the GFR? You're in Alabama, Patient: me. [/INST] Nurse: GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate, Mr. Hardy. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. It estimates how much blood passes through the glomeruli each minute. Glomeruli are the tiny filters in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood. A GFR of 90 mL/min/1.73m2, like yours, is within the normal range, indicating your kidneys are functioning well. Does that help clarify things for you? [INST] Patient: Yeah. And what does urine and albin mom mean? [/INST] Nurse: Urine albumin is a test that measures the amount of albumin in your urine. Albumin is a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. A high level of albumin in the urine can be a sign of kidney disease. Your urine albumin level is 82 mg/g, which is a bit high. This is something your doctor will likely want to monitor closely. Does that answer your question, Mr. Hardy? [INST] Patient: Yes. It does. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome, Mr. Hardy. I'm glad I could help clarify those terms for you. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Lisinopril 5 mg daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Hardy. Taking your medication as prescribed is crucial for managing your conditions. Now, let's move on to the next medication. You're also prescribed Apixaban 5 mg, to be taken two times a day. Have you been taking this medication as directed? [INST] Patient: Uh-huh. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent, Mr. Hardy. Sticking to your medication schedule is very important, especially for managing conditions like atrial fibrillation. Now, let's discuss your insulin. You're prescribed Insulin Lantus 100 IU/mL prefilled pen, with a dosage of 10 units every night at bedtime. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great, Mr. Hardy. Regularly taking your insulin as prescribed is key to managing your diabetes. Lastly, you're also prescribed Aspart 100 IU/mL prefilled pen, with a dosage of 3 units three times a day. Have you been taking this medication as directed? [INST] Patient: Uh-huh. [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Hardy. It's critical to take your medications as prescribed to manage your blood sugar levels effectively. I want to remind you that there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for patients with chronic kidney disease to take. Always talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over-the-counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Mr. Hardy. [INST] Patient: Why am I taking that specific dosage number of app, Pick n Pay, \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Hardy, could you please repeat your question? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Why am I taking that specific dosage of act act apixaban. [/INST] Nurse: Your specific dosage of Apixaban is determined by your doctor based on your medical history, current health status, and response to the medication. Apixaban is an anticoagulant, or blood thinner, used to prevent blood clots in people with certain heart conditions, like atrial fibrillation, which you have. The goal is to prevent strokes and blood clots in your legs and lungs. Your doctor has prescribed a dosage of 5 mg two times a day. It's essential to take this medication as prescribed to manage your condition effectively. Does that answer your question, Mr. Hardy? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad I could provide the information you needed, Mr. Hardy. Now, let's talk a bit about your diet. Could you tell me about some of the meals you've had recently? [INST] Patient: Well, I I wanna ask you, Rachel, what dietary changes can I make to Go with that diet and preserve my kidney function? My health is very important to me. [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your proactive approach to managing your health, Mr. Hardy. Would it be okay if I provide some dietary recommendations that could help preserve your kidney function? [INST] Patient: That would be fantastic. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Hardy. [INST] Patient: Sir. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Hardy. One dietary approach that can help manage your kidney health is the DASH diet, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. This diet is high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, and low in sodium, added sugars, and unhealthy fats. It's also important to limit your protein intake, as too much protein can put a strain on your kidneys. Also, try to avoid foods high in potassium and phosphorus, as your kidneys may have trouble removing these substances from your blood. Do you feel you can incorporate these changes into your diet? [INST] Patient: I don't see why not. [/INST] Nurse: That's a positive attitude, Mr. Hardy. Remember, making these dietary changes can have a significant impact on your kidney health. Now, let's discuss your atrial fibrillation. Have you been experiencing any symptoms such as heart palpitations or irregular heartbeat recently? [INST] Patient: Oh, no. None of that. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Hardy. It's important to keep an eye on any symptoms related to your atrial fibrillation. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits.
