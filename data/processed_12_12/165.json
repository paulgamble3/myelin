Let's let's dive in. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Valenzuela. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained and long-lasting diarrhea.

And I'm aware what it does. Basically, it does more bleeding. Which makes sense. So I'm not [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: That's correct, Mr. Valenzuela.
