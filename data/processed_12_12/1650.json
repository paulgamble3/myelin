        "G2": "Thank you, Mr. Oliver. The DASH diet emphasizes eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. It also recommends limiting foods high in saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium. For example, when preparing your chicken soup, you could consider using low-sodium broth and adding more vegetables. Do you have any questions about this?",
        "G5": "Excellent, Mr. Oliver. One suggestion is to continue incorporating a variety of vegetables in your meals. They are low in sodium and high in potassium and magnesium, which can help manage your blood pressure. Also, try to limit your intake of processed foods and opt for whole grains instead of refined grains. Lastly, consider using herbs and spices to flavor your food instead of salt. Does that sound good to you?",
        "G7": "Great. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like chicken. It also recommends limiting sodium and added sugars. For your chicken soup, you could add more vegetables and use herbs and spices for flavor instead of salt. How does that sound?",
        "gpt4": "Thank you, Mr. Oliver. The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is proven to help manage blood pressure and is heart-healthy. It's good to see you're already incorporating lean proteins and plenty of vegetables into your meals, which is recommended in the DASH diet. \n\nYou might also want to consider including more whole grains, like brown rice or whole grain pasta. Additionally, try reducing your intake of processed foods and those high in sodium, such as canned soups or ready-made meals, if you eat those. \n\nRemember to limit your intake of sugars and sweets, too. As a friendly reminder, though you're managing your blood sugar well, it's essential to keep monitoring it. How are you finding incorporating these suggestions into your diet?"
