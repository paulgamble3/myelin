        "G2": "I'm glad to hear you're taking your medications as prescribed, Yu Zhong. As for your question about turkey burgers, I would recommend discussing this with your dietician. They can provide the most accurate advice based on your specific dietary needs. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your medications or diet?",
        "G5": "I'm sorry, Yu Zhong, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question?",
        "G7": "I'm glad to hear you're taking your medications. As for your diet question, a dietician would be the best person to answer that. They can provide guidance on how to manage your diet in a way that supports your health and takes into account your CKD and Maple Syrup Urine Disease. Do you have any other questions about your medications?",
        "gpt4": "That's an excellent question, Yu Zhong. While turkey burgers can be a part of a healthy diet, it's important to be mindful of your protein intake due to your Maple Syrup Urine Disease and CKD. Turkey is a source of protein, and its consumption should be moderated. This is something you can discuss in detail with the dietician. I'm glad to hear you're taking your Valsartan and Lasix as directed. Do you ever have any trouble remembering to take your medication on time?"
