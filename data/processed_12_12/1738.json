        "G2": "That's a great question, Ola. As a vegetarian, you can focus on eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. These foods are generally low in sodium and phosphorus, which can help preserve kidney function. However, it's important to monitor your intake of high-potassium fruits and vegetables, as they can sometimes be harmful to kidneys. Would you like me to provide more specific dietary recommendations?",
        "G5": "That's a great question, Ola. A vegetarian diet can be very beneficial for kidney health. You might consider limiting your intake of high-phosphorus foods, such as dairy products and whole grains, and increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables. Also, try to limit your sodium intake as it can increase blood pressure and put extra strain on your kidneys. Would you like me to provide more specific dietary recommendations?",
        "G7": "That's a great question. A dietitian would be the best person to answer that question. I will make a note for your doctor to arrange a consultation with a dietitian to discuss dietary changes that can help preserve your kidney function. Do you have any other questions or concerns?",
        "gpt4": "That's a great question, Ola. I'm not a doctor, but I can share some general advice on diet for kidney health. It's usually recommended to maintain a balanced diet with a variety of vegetables for CKD patients. Nonetheless, it would be best to consult with a dietitian who understands your personal nutritional needs. Can I proceed to review some points about your symptoms and condition?"
