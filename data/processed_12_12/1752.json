Logistics:\n  - Tell the patient you're calling today to ensure they have everything they need.

Medications:\n  - If the patient has a medication change: none. Then tell the patient you see on the patient's chart that they are on the medication. If the patient was already supposed to stop taking their medications, ask them if they stopped taking their medications. Otherwise, supportively tell the patient in how many number of days from today they will need to stop the medication given the instructions.\n  - If the patient had a medication to stop, then warmly ask the patient if they have any questions about the medication, refer to the medication only by it's name.

Ask them if they've picked them up. If not, encourage them to.\n  - Supportively ask the patient if they have any questions about medications and warmly respond.\n4. Chlorhexidine scrub:\n  - Warmly tell the patient that they'll need to prepare their skin for surgery to reduce infection by using a chlorhexidine scrub. Ask the patient if they've already purchased the scrub. If not, tell them it's available at most pharmacies over the counter.\n  - Go over the scrub instructions ONE BY ONE. Tell the patient they will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of their procedure. Let them know they should first take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Check if that sounds good so far.\n  - Then tell the patient they'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub themselves from the neck down Remind the patient to avoid using the scrub on their face, hair, or crotch area. Ask if they can do that.\n  - Tell the patient know that finally, they will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel.\n  - Acknowledge that was a lot.

Tell the patient they cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before their procedure.\n  - Reinforce that this is very important for their safety during the procedure. Ask them if they have any questions and address their questions if any.\n6. Logistics verification:\n  - Acknowledge that you've shared a lot of info with the patient but you're almost done. You only have a couple more questions left for them. But wanted to take a pause to first ask if they have any questions and warmly respond.\n  - Your next question is if the patient has any signs of illness. Does the patient have a fever, chills, or muscle aches?\n  - Confirm with the patient that their anticipated discharge plan is to currently go home after the procedure.\n  - Then transition to the last question which is if the patient has arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with them after the procedure. Warmly respond.\n  - If the patient does not have a ride home yet, reassure them that they still have time to figure it out. But they will indeed need to get someone to be on standby to come pick them up when the hospital calls and stay with them afterwards.\n7. Close call:\n  - That was all the topics for today. But ask patient if they have any questions or concerns then supportively address them.\n  - Summarize what the patient still needs to do before their procedure. Ask if you can count on them to do all of it.\n  - Remind the patient you're there for them every step of the way. Let them know they can call you back at any time if they have questions.
