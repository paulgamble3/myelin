        "G7": "Of course. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test that measures how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. Albumin is a type of protein. The urine albumin test measures the amount of albumin in your urine.  Do you have any other questions?",
        "gpt4": "GFR, which stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate, is the test used to measure how much blood your kidneys filter each minute. This shows how well your kidneys are functioning. Urine albumin measures the amount of a protein called albumin in your urine and is used to check for kidney damage. Too much albumin in the urine can indicate that your kidneys are not working optimally. Can you tell me if there's anything else you want to understand about these labs, Mr. Hardy?"
