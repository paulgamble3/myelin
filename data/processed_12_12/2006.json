        "G7": "Of course. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test that measures how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. Your GFR is 67, which is in the stage 2 range of kidney disease. This means your kidneys are working well enough, but not at their full potential. We'll continue to monitor this. Does that answer your question?",
