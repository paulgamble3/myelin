I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Jami Wyatt, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately? [INST] Patient: It's been alright. Thanks. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? [INST] Patient: Nothing in particular. Just the same old. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine. Sometimes, it's nice to have a routine. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you enjoy doing in your free time? [INST] Patient: Sometimes I play soccer with my coworkers from work. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a lot of fun! Soccer is a great way to stay active. How often do you get to play with your coworkers? [INST] Patient: Like, once or twice a month. [/INST] Nurse: That's great! It's always good to have a balance of work and play. Before we move on, is there anything you've been feeling concerned about health-wise that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent. Could you share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was? [INST] Patient: One twelve. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's important to keep your blood sugar levels in check. Would you be open to some suggestions on how to manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. One strategy is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, and incorporating a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Another strategy is regular physical activity, which can help your body use insulin more effectively. Lastly, taking your prescribed medications as directed is crucial in managing your blood sugar levels. Do these suggestions sound manageable to you? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Well, is my number normal? [/INST] Nurse: Your blood sugar level of 120 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes, which is usually under 120. However, it's not too far off. With the strategies we discussed, you should be able to bring it down. Regular monitoring and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can really help. Now, let's talk about your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was? [INST] Patient: Well, hold on. I didn't say one twenty. I said one twelve. [/INST] Nurse: I apologize for the misunderstanding. A blood sugar level of 112 is within the target range for people with diabetes. That's a good reading. Let's move on to your blood pressure.

[/INST] Nurse: Great question. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A lower GFR can be a sign that your kidneys aren't working as well as they should be. Your GFR is 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which is a bit lower than normal. This is something your doctor will continue to monitor. Does that help clarify things? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, let's move on to your medications. You're currently taking Valsartan 40 mg once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: How do I avoid going into dialysis?
