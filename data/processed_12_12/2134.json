[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Thelma Odonnell? [INST] Patient: Yes. Yes. It is. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Susan Ma, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately? [INST] Patient: I'm pretty scared lately. [/INST] Nurse: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling scared. Can you share more about what's been causing you to feel this way? [INST] Patient: I'm just scared I'm gonna have to do dialysis. [/INST] Nurse: I can understand how the thought of dialysis can be daunting. It's a big change and it's normal to feel scared. Is there anything specific you're worried about regarding dialysis? [INST] Patient: I it just scares me. I don't like anything about it. [/INST] Nurse: I can see how the unknown can be frightening. It's okay to feel this way. We're here to support you and help you understand the process better. Is there anything else you're concerned about or any other symptoms you've been experiencing lately? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If you have any questions or concerns at any point, feel free to ask. Would it be alright if we go over a few topics related to your kidney disease now? [INST] Patient: Yeah. That's fine. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? [INST] Patient: Yes. The last I checked, it was one twenty one. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. A blood sugar level of 121 is a bit higher than the target range. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: I guess so. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. One strategy is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, and incorporating a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Another strategy is regular physical activity. This doesn't have to be strenuous; even a daily walk can make a difference. Lastly, it's important to take your medications as prescribed. Do you feel these are strategies you could incorporate into your daily routine? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. Now, let's talk about your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was? [INST] Patient: This morning, and it was about [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat the reading? [INST] Patient: One ten over Ninety. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that.

Would it be alright if I share some suggestions on how to maintain a healthy blood pressure? [INST] Patient: No. I think I'm okay. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If you ever have any questions or concerns about your blood pressure, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Heard that it's really scary if the potassium is high. And what does GFR mean? [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question. Potassium is a mineral that helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, work properly. If your potassium level is too high, it can cause heart problems. Your potassium level is 3.4 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. As for GFR, it stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. Your GFR is 58 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are functioning at a level consistent with Stage IIIA CKD. Does that help clarify things for you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently taking Apixaban 5 mg oral tablet, 10 mg once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?

Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. It's important to keep up with your medication schedule. Just a reminder, there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for patients with chronic kidney disease to take.

Now, let's talk about your diet. Can you tell me about your recent meals? [INST] Patient: A low salt, low phosphorus, carb controlled diet, and I was wondering How I could better follow a low phosphorus diet? What food should I avoid? What food should I eat more of? [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question. It's critical to limit foods high in phosphorus, such as dairy products, beans, lentils, nuts, and whole grains.
