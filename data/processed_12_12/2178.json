        "G2": "Great, Jordan. One method could be setting reminders on your phone or a clock. Another could be associating taking your medication with a daily routine, like brushing your teeth. This way, it becomes a part of your daily routine. How do you feel about these suggestions?",
        "G5": "Great, Jordan. One method could be setting reminders on your phone or using a pill organizer. Another could be associating your medication times with daily activities, like brushing your teeth. Would you be open to trying either of these?",
        "G7": "Great. One thing that might help is setting a daily alarm on your phone to remind you to take your medications. Do you think that would be helpful?",
        "gpt4": "Great, Jordan! One thing that often helps is setting an alarm on your phone or having a medication schedule posted somewhere you frequently see. Combining it with a daily activity like brushing your teeth can also serve as a reminder. You're doing a great job by continuing to take them despite not liking it. Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to ask a few questions about your symptoms to better understand your condition at home."
