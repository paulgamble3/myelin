[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Liz Grimes? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you. I'm calling about your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 10:00 AM. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Sir? [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry for any confusion. I'm calling from O'Connor Hospital to discuss your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 10:00 AM. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Okay. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you for your time. How has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: Fine. Patient: I've had work [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. [INST] Patient: That's just been a bit annoying. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that your work has been a bit annoying. It's never easy when things don't go as smoothly as we'd like. How are you feeling about your upcoming colonoscopy procedure? [INST] Patient: Mean, I know it's necessary, but [/INST] Nurse: I can imagine that it's not the most pleasant procedure to think about. It's completely normal to have some apprehension. [INST] Patient: Of and Patient: and [/INST] Nurse: I can imagine that it's a bit nerve-wracking. [INST] Patient: a problem. But it's preventative. So I suppose that's a good thing. [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely. It's great that you're taking this step for preventative screening. It can be quite a process, but it's a crucial step in taking care of your health. Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we go over the details of the procedure? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If you have any questions at any point during our conversation, feel free to ask. I'm here to help. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy as a preventative screening for colon cancer. It's really important to take these steps for your health. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your procedure. We'll also have another call the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our list. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions leading up to your colonoscopy? [INST] Patient: I just know that I can't eat anything the day It's a few days before, but Patient: or, like, I no. So why don't you just tell me? [/INST] Nurse: Of course, I'd be happy to. In the days leading up to your colonoscopy, you'll need to follow a low-fiber diet. This means avoiding whole grains, nuts, seeds, dried fruit, and raw fruits or vegetables. The day before your procedure, you'll need to switch to a clear liquid diet. This includes broths, clear juices, and gelatin desserts. You'll also need to avoid any red or purple liquids as they can interfere with the results of your colonoscopy. Does that help clarify things? [INST] Patient: What why red and purple liquids? [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question. Red and purple liquids can be mistaken for blood during the colonoscopy, which could lead to a misdiagnosis. It's just a precaution to ensure the most accurate results. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you?
