I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Jack Smith to check in on you. How have you been doing? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I'm doing okay. How are you? [/INST] Nurse: I'm doing well, thank you. It's good to hear that you're okay. Are there any activities or events you're looking forward to this week? [INST] Patient: This week, Not really. No. It's gonna be a boring week. [/INST] Nurse: Oh, that's alright. Sometimes calm weeks can be nice too. Can you tell me what you normally do during your day? [INST] Patient: Doing [/INST] Nurse: I see. [INST] Patient: Good damn. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat yourself? [INST] Patient: Well, I go to work. And then I Come home and I cook it. [/INST] Nurse: It sounds like you enjoy cooking. Is that correct? [INST] Patient: And I clean my Patient: you know, get my kids from school. [/INST] Nurse: It sounds like you have a busy day. Do you work from home or outside the home? [INST] Patient: I work outside. [/INST] Nurse: I see. And do you enjoy your work? [INST] Patient: Some days. [/INST] Nurse: I understand. It can be challenging at times. I hope you have a good balance. Now, before we continue, I need to verify your identity. Could you please provide your date of birth? [INST] Patient: Four six nineteen eighty. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. I see here that you have been diagnosed with Lupus and Stage one CKD. How are you managing with these conditions? [INST] Patient: Well, I'm doing okay at the moment. No flare ups lately. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. I see you have an upcoming appointment with Doctor Smith next week. How has your appetite been lately? [INST] Patient: My appetite? No. It's been good. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to know. I also see that you have been prescribed Cellcept 500 mg twice a day. Are you still taking this medication? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. How has your experience been with this medication? [INST] Patient: It really helps with my lupus. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. I also see that you've had some lab tests done recently. I'd like to discuss them with you. Is that okay? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Your sodium levels are a bit low at 139. We prefer patients to have levels between 135 to 145. Your potassium levels are also slightly low at 3.9. We prefer these between 3.5 and 5.1. Your BUN level is slightly high at 2.89. We prefer this to be around 10 to 18. Your creatinine level is slightly high as well at 0.7. We prefer this to be around 0.3 to 0.6. Your GFR is slightly low at 94. We prefer this to be around 88 to 130. Your urine albumin is slightly high at 78. We prefer this to be around 0 to 15. I know these might seem a bit overwhelming, but they can help us understand how well your kidneys are functioning. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: Yes. But So you're telling me [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question? [INST] Patient: That my sodium potassium levels are really bad. [/INST] Nurse: They're not necessarily bad, but they could be better. Slightly low levels can happen with CKD. This can sometimes happen if you're eating a lot of processed foods that are high in sodium. Does your diet include a lot of processed foods? [INST] Patient: Processed foods. No. [/INST] Nurse: That's great. Eating fresh foods can really help maintain your nutrient levels. I think it would be beneficial to schedule an appointment with a dietitian. They can provide more personalized advice based on your condition and preferences. Would you be okay with that? [INST] Patient: Definitely. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. I'll arrange that for you. I also wanted to ask if you're experiencing any swelling or shortness of breath? [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: Ms. Arnold, are you there? [INST] Patient: No. Not at all.

Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. It's essential to stay hydrated. I also wanted to ask if you're having any issues with sleep? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's great. Rest is very important for your overall health. I will schedule an appointment with a dietitian for you and also make sure Doctor Smith is updated on your lab results. Before we end, do you have any questions for me? [INST] Patient: Let me think. [/INST] Nurse: Take your time.
