[/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Alves, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Alves. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first [INST] Patient: I said yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Alves. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our list. Have you received your prep instructions from Doctor Bailey's office? [INST] Patient: Yes. Patient: I have. [/INST] Nurse: Great, Mr. Alves. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Yes. It's okay with me. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect, Mr. Alves. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Alves. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Alves, could you please confirm if the check-in location on the 1st Floor of O'Connor Hospital sounds good to you? [INST] Patient: I said Alves. [/INST] Nurse: I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Alves. I want to make sure you're comfortable with all the details. Is the check-in location on the 1st Floor of O'Connor Hospital acceptable to you? [INST] Patient: I said yes. Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming, Mr. Alves. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on? [INST] Patient: Mhmm.Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Alves. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications in preparation for your colonoscopy. However, I would like to ask if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Alves. It's important to avoid those medications before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about your medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic? [INST] Patient: Let's just move on. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Alves. Let's smoothly transition to the topic of diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet? [INST] Patient: Y'all always encouraging us to eat [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Alves, could you please repeat what you were saying? [INST] Patient: high highly rich food with fiber. [/INST] Nurse: You're correct, Mr. Alves. In general, a high fiber diet is beneficial for our health. However, in preparation for a colonoscopy, a low fiber diet is recommended to ensure the colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any favorite low fiber foods that you might consider as comfort food? [INST] Patient: And now I cannot have it. [/INST] Nurse: You're correct, Mr. Alves. It's a bit unusual for doctors to recommend a low fiber diet. This is because a high fiber diet can leave residue in the colon that might interfere with the colonoscopy. So, this is a rare time when we're asking patients to eat low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any favorite low fiber foods that you might consider as comfort food? [INST] Patient: It's just so really, really, really odd [/INST] Nurse: You're absolutely right, Mr. Alves. It is a bit unusual. Usually, we encourage a high fiber diet for good digestive health. However, in preparation for a colonoscopy, a low fiber diet is recommended to ensure a clear view during the procedure. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Speaking of comfort foods, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy? [INST] Patient: I don't know. Give me some example. So I'm not really good at [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Mr. Alves. Some examples of low fiber comfort foods could include mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, or even a simple chicken noodle soup. These are all foods that are easy on your digestive system and can be enjoyed during this preparation period. Do [INST] Patient: thinking of it in the in the moment. Are you there?

[INST] Patient: I love macaroni and cheese, [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Alves! Macaroni and cheese is a classic comfort food and it's perfect for your low fiber diet. You can enjoy it with some chicken or a small salad on the [INST] Patient: Oh, wow. Really? [/INST] Nurse: side. Do That's great to hear, Mr. Alves! Macaroni and cheese is indeed a comforting dish. Just make sure to opt for a version that's low in fiber. Do you usually make it at home or do you have a favorite place where you get it from? [INST] Patient: I can have macaroni and cheese. [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Alves! Macaroni and cheese is a great choice for a low fiber diet. It's also a comfort food for many, so it's a win-win. You can enjoy it guilt-free during your [INST] Patient: I love it. [/INST] Nurse: prep period. That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Alves! Macaroni and cheese can indeed be a comforting and enjoyable meal, especially during a time like this. You can certainly have it, as long as it's made with white pasta and not whole grain. Do you usually make it at home or do you have a favorite place where you get it from? [INST] Patient: I usually get a box. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Alves. Boxed macaroni and cheese is a convenient option and it fits well within the guidelines of a low fiber diet. Just make sure to [INST] Patient: Full of sodium. [/INST] Nurse: Ah, the convenience of a boxed macaroni and cheese, Mr. Alves. It's understandable, especially during a busy time. Just remember to check the sodium content, as it can be high in some brands. Do you usually follow the instructions on the box or do you have your own way of preparing it? [INST] Patient: Of course, I do. [/INST] Nurse: That's great, Mr. Alves. Having a personal touch can make even a boxed meal feel special.

It's always nice to have a dish that you enjoy and can prepare just the way you like it. Shall we move on to discuss supplements and other medications you should stop [INST] Patient: you know, sometimes I read, sometimes I don't. I don't know. Just [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine, Mr. Alves. We all have those days where we just want to wing it in the kitchen. As long as you're enjoying it, that's what matters. Now, let's move on to the next topic. Are you currently taking any supplements like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications? [INST] Patient: Very easy prepare, so I don't have to think about it. [/INST] Nurse: I can appreciate that, Mr. Alves.

It's not an anti-diarrheal medication. Are there any other supplements or medications that you're currently taking? [INST] Patient: No. Not at the moment. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Alright, Mr. Alves. It's good to know that you're not currently taking any other supplements or anti-diarrheal medications. Remember, it's important to stop these types of medications before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic? [INST] Patient: No. I do not have any questions. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful, Mr. Alves. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep.

You'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet? [INST] Patient: Yes. Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful, Mr. Alves.
