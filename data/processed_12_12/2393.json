        "G2": "That's a very valid concern, Curtis. It can be challenging to distinguish between symptoms of different conditions. We'll go over some symptoms later in our conversation to help you understand them better. But for now, let's start with your new medication. Have you been able to pick up your Metoprolol 25 mg oral tablet?",
        "G5": "That's a very important question. It can be challenging to distinguish between symptoms. I'll make sure to explain everything as clearly as possible. Is it alright if we start with your medications?",
        "G7": "That's a very valid concern, Curtis. It's important to remember that managing CHF and asthma can be challenging, but we're here to help. We'll go over the symptoms for each and how to monitor them at home. If you have any questions at any time, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I'd like to start by asking about your new medication, Metoprolol. Have you been able to pick it up from the pharmacy?",
        "gpt4": "That's a legitimate concern and it's common to feel that way when managing coexisting conditions like asthma and CHF. Various symptoms can overlap, and it's important to understand which could be related to which condition, so you can manage them effectively. Remember you can always reach out to your healthcare providers for help.  For now, would it help if we review your medications and then discuss some common symptoms related to CHF, and how to track them at home?"
