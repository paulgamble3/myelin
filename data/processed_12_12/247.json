[/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your question, Mr. Wiggins. There are five stages of kidney disease, with stage 1 being the mildest and stage 5 being the most severe. Stage 2, which you're in, means that your kidneys are not working at their full potential, but they're still functioning reasonably well. It's important to manage your health to prevent progression to later stages. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Oh, wow. I didn't know that.

Your current lab results indicate that you're in Stage II CKD, which means there's some kidney damage and a mild decrease in kidney function. However, this is an early stage and with proper management, it's possible to slow down the progression of the disease. Dialysis is typically not needed until much later stages, when kidney function is significantly reduced. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics to check on how you're doing? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Wiggins. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly.
