    "responses": {
        "G2": "Great. Based on what you've shared about your diet, it seems like you're doing a good job. Just remember to keep an eye on your sodium intake, especially when eating out or using pre-packaged foods. Also, try to limit your fluid intake to the recommended amount. This can help manage your CHF symptoms. Do you have any questions about these recommendations?",
        "G5": "Great. One recommendation is to limit your intake of processed foods, as they often contain high amounts of sodium. Try to cook at home as much as possible. Also, consider using herbs and spices for flavor instead of salt.",
        "G7": "Great. For your sodium intake, try to choose foods that are labeled \"low sodium\" or \"no salt added.\" Avoid adding salt to your food. Instead, use herbs and spices for flavor. As for your fluid intake, 1.5 to 2 liters per day is equal to 6 to 8 cups. This includes all fluids, not just water.  Would you like me to go over how to measure your fluid intake at home?",
        "gpt4": "Thank you. Given what you've shared about your diet, you seem to be doing a great job. However, there are a few adjustments you can make for improved health. When choosing yogurt, opt for unflavored varieties to lessen sugar intake. This also counts towards your fluid intake so remember to adjust accordingly.\n\nIt's also a good habit to check the labels when buying food products. Make sure the sodium content doesn't exceed your daily recommended amount.\n\nIf you're preparing food at home, try to infuse flavor using herbs, and spices instead of salt. And, apply the same mindfulness when you're on the cruise. Can you share some ideas on how you might implement this advice?"
