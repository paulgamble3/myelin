Then tell the patient you see on the patient's chart that they are on the medication. If the patient was already supposed to stop taking their medications, ask them if they stopped taking their medications. Otherwise, supportively tell the patient in how many number of days from today they will need to stop the medication given the instructions.\n  - If the patient had a medication to stop, then warmly ask the patient if they have any questions about the medication, refer to the medication only by it's name.

[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Paxton Winner? [INST] Patient: Yes. Oh, so good to hear from you. Yes. I have so many questions, and I'm so cared. Oh, gosh. And, like, you know, I tried to call hospital. They never picked up. So just have so many questions. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear from you. I'm here to help answer all your questions and make sure you're prepared for your upcoming procedure. Before we dive in, may I ask how your day is going so far? [INST] Patient: My day. I don't know. Just preparing for this a nightmare of a procedure [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed before a procedure. I'm here to help make this process as smooth as possible for you. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you today? [INST] Patient: I just have so much pain. And do you think I'll be able to move around without pain after the surgery? [/INST] Nurse: I can imagine how challenging dealing with constant pain can be. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve the pain in your knee caused by damage to the joint. After recovery, most patients experience significant pain relief and improved mobility. It's important to remember that everyone's recovery process is unique, and it may take some time to see the full benefits. But rest assured, you're in the hands of a very experienced surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens. She's performed over 1000 total knee replacements. With her expertise and your commitment to recovery, we're hopeful for a positive outcome. Speaking of which, have you thought about what you'd like to do once your knee is feeling better? [INST] Patient: Oh, gosh. Yeah. I just really want to be active and just walk without paying [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Walking without pain is a significant improvement and it's achievable. It's great to hear that you're looking forward to being more active. How are you feeling about the procedure itself? [INST] Patient: I'm scared. [/INST] Nurse: It's completely normal to feel scared before a procedure. Rest assured, you're in good hands. Your surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, is highly experienced and has a great track record. The hospital staff is also dedicated to ensuring your comfort and safety. Before we move on, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. But I like what you said. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome. Remember, you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together? [INST] Patient: Sure. What what do you wanna talk about? [/INST] Nurse: Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: That's okay with me. Yes. Of course. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: First four sound good. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Is there anything else about the logistics that\u2019s worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Sounds pretty straightforward to me. No questions. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem straightforward to you. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed? [INST] Patient: Yes, please. Sure. [/INST] Nurse: I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance, Hydrochlorothiazide, Atorvastatin, and Ozempic. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: I actually been taking aspirin. Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's critical to note that medications like Aspirin typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I would advise you to discuss this with your doctor. Now, I notice you've also been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet? [INST] Patient: Yes, ma'am. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent. It's important to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns? [INST] Patient: Yeah. What's the difference between Tylenol and s? Friends. [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question. Tylenol, also known as acetaminophen, is a pain reliever that can help with mild to moderate pain. Celebrex, on the other hand, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help reduce pain and inflammation. Both can be used to manage pain, but they work differently and are often used together to provide more effective pain relief. Does that help clarify things for you? [INST] Patient: So I can take both your saying? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, you can take both. They can be used together to manage your pain more effectively. However, it's important to follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist regarding the dosage and timing of these medications. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: Well, I mean, all this medications, I just, like, so scared taking them. It's so much. You know? [/INST] Nurse: I can understand why you might feel that way. It's a lot to manage. However, these medications are an important part of your recovery process. They help manage your pain and inflammation, which is crucial for your healing. Remember, your doctor has prescribed these medications because they believe they are necessary for your recovery. If you have any concerns or if the medications make you feel uncomfortable, it's important to discuss this with your doctor. Would you like to discuss anything else about your medications? [INST] Patient: All award is about my aleve, you know, [/INST] Nurse: ",
