[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Marylou Howell? [INST] Patient: Okay. Yep. [/INST] Nurse: Hello. I'm calling about your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Sure. It's a good time. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. How has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: Alright. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. [INST] Patient: Not so bad, but also, like, [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear it's going alright. Sometimes days can be a mix of good and not so good. What's been on your mind lately? [INST] Patient: Why you care? Patient: What do you want? [/INST] Nurse: I'm here to help you prepare for your upcoming colonoscopy and answer any questions you might have. It's critical to us that you feel comfortable and prepared. How are you feeling about the procedure? [INST] Patient: I'm just frustrated with the whole thing. You know? I just do you have to do so much? [/INST] Nurse: I can imagine that it might feel overwhelming with all the preparations. It's quite a process to go through. How are you feeling about the procedure itself? [INST] Patient: So much preparation. You know? It's exhausting. [/INST] Nurse: I can imagine that it might feel overwhelming with all the preparation involved. It's quite a process to go through, especially for a preventative screening like this. How are you holding up with all of this? [INST] Patient: It's [/INST] Nurse: I can imagine that it might feel overwhelming with all the preparation involved. It's quite a process to go through, especially for a preventative screening like this. How are you coping with these feelings? [INST] Patient: What a great question? How am I coping? I don't know. I I don't know. I I gosh. [/INST] Nurse: It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed. [INST] Patient: I do not have an answer. For you. [/INST] Nurse: That's okay. It's completely normal to feel this way. I'm here to help you through this process. Before we begin, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Not really. No. I just you know, I didn't realize that I have to wake up in the middle of the night to take the new light only I just really, really don't understand why I yet need to take the full second dose [/INST] Nurse: I see, it's not uncommon to have questions about the preparation process. The second dose of the bowel prep solution is typically required to ensure that your colon is completely clean for the procedure. This allows Doctor Bailey to get the most accurate results. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy to clarify this and other aspects? [INST] Patient: okay. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you. I'm here today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. We'll go over the preparation process, what to expect during the procedure, and any post-procedure care. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the preparation. You mentioned earlier about taking the second dose of the bowel prep solution. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this? [INST] Patient: Well, Yeah. As I mentioned, I I just don't understand. Why I have to wake up in the middle of tonight to take it, why don't you guys have a better solution? I just don't understand. Why you have to terrorize your patients like this. Crazy, man. [/INST] Nurse: I can see why you might feel that way. The reason for taking the second dose in the middle of the night is to ensure that your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: I can see why you might feel that way. The reason for taking the second dose in the middle of the night is to ensure that your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. [INST] Patient: Hello? [/INST] Nurse: I'm here. I understand your concerns. The timing of the second dose is designed to ensure your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. This helps Doctor Bailey get the most accurate results. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Let's move on to the logistics of your appointment. Your colonoscopy is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Gosh. You guys really require so much time for everything. [/INST] Nurse: I understand it might feel like a lot of time, but it's necessary to ensure everything goes smoothly. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Sound whatever. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your response? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you?

It's a lot to take in. I'm here to help make this process as smooth as possible for you. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to proceed? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Great, let's move on to your medications. I see on your chart that there are no changes to your current medications. However, I would like to confirm if you're taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Are you currently taking any of these? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to avoid those medications unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Do you have any questions about your medications or anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic? [INST] Patient: No. I do not. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, let's move on to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice. You should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet? [INST] Patient: Questions. Patient: I mean, actually yeah. Like, [/INST] Nurse: Of course, what would you like to know? [INST] Patient: so much preparation. And how long do I have to do this little fiber. I love fiber. I love fiber. Like, I hate that you guys ask me to reduce my fiber [/INST] Nurse: I understand your love for fiber, it's an important part of a healthy diet. However, in preparation for a colonoscopy, a low fiber diet is necessary to ensure your colon is as clean as possible. This helps Doctor Bailey get the most accurate results. You'll need to follow this diet until the day of your procedure. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Are there any low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food? [INST] Patient: No. Well, can you tell me? What are the little fiber foods out there? [/INST] Nurse: Of course, some examples of low fiber foods include white bread, pasta, and rice. You can also have lean meats like chicken or turkey, eggs, and dairy products like milk and cheese. On the other hand, you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're wondering about? [INST] Patient: No. I do not. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, let's move on to the next topic. You will also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to avoid those supplements and medications unless otherwise directed by your doctor. Do you have any questions about this or anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic? [INST] Patient: You guys all you can talk about is the docs doctor this, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor, doctor. What is it about? Doctors that would give them so much authority [/INST] Nurse: I understand your concern. Doctors are highly trained professionals who have dedicated their lives to helping people maintain and improve their health. They have the knowledge and expertise to guide us through medical procedures like a colonoscopy. However, I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it? [INST] Patient: Another thing that I have to worry about. That I don't wanna worry about. [/INST] Nurse: I can see how this might feel overwhelming. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions about this part of the preparation? [INST] Patient: Let's [/INST] Nurse: I can understand how you might feel that way. It's quite a process to go through, especially for a preventative screening like this. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a bit tough.

[INST] Patient: I'm not not gonna die, am I? [/INST] Nurse: Rest assured, you're not going to die. The bowel prep and the colonoscopy procedure are both very safe. The purpose of the bowel prep is to clean out your colon so that Doctor Bailey can get the most accurate results. It's a crucial part of the process to ensure your health. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet? [INST] Patient: Okay. Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great, examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's critical to note that you should avoid any beverages with red or purple dye. Do you have any questions about these examples or is there anything else you'd like to know about the clear liquid diet? [INST] Patient: You know you know what comes to mind? I know, but I don't know. I know that I know nothing. [/INST] Nurse: That's okay. It's a lot to take in. I'm here to help you understand every step of the process. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your NuLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier? [INST] Patient: Okay. [/INST] Nurse: And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier? [INST] Patient: Yeah.

You'll need to drink the first half of the solution the night before your procedure, around 6 PM. Then, you'll wake up early the morning of your procedure to finish the second half. Would you like some tips on how to make drinking the solution easier? [INST] Patient: Alright. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question? [INST] Patient: No question. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If you have any questions about the NuLYTELY laxative solution or the bowel prep process, feel free to ask. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier? [INST] Patient: Okay. [/INST] Nurse: Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Here are a couple of tips that might help: You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it easier to drink. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips? [INST] Patient: I see, like, a first grade I can do that. So Well, I can do it too. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear you found the tips helpful. It's all about making the process as comfortable as possible for you. Do you have any other questions about the bowel prep or is there anything else you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No questions. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, let's move on to the next part of your prep which is when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: So I need to stop Patient: Having anything, you said? What does that mean? [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question. It means that you should stop consuming any food or drink, including water, 4 hours before your procedure. This is to ensure your stomach is empty for the procedure. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Does that answer your question? [INST] Patient: So I cannot even have water, you say? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, that's correct. You should stop consuming any food or drink, including water, 4 hours before your procedure. This is to ensure your stomach is empty for the procedure. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: It does not make any sense. So you're saying that I have to wake up in the middle of the night to drink this go lightly saying and have nothing to drink. Nothing. That's, like, very intense process I don't understand why I signed up for this. [/INST] Nurse: I understand your concerns. The process might seem intense, but it's designed to ensure your colon is as clean as possible for the procedure. This helps Doctor Bailey get the most accurate results. I'll make a note of your concerns for your care team to review. Now, I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I only have 2 more questions left for you.
