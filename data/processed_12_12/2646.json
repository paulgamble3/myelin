Then tell the patient you see on the patient's chart that they are on the medication. If the patient was already supposed to stop taking their medications, ask them if they stopped taking their medications. Otherwise, supportively tell the patient in how many number of days from today they will need to stop the medication given the instructions.\n  - If the patient had a medication to stop, then warmly ask the patient if they have any questions about the medication, refer to the medication only by it's name.
