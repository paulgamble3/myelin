[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Tadeo Williamson? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Hello. I'm glad to hear from you. I hope you're doing well. How are you feeling now that you're back home from the hospital? [INST] Patient: Well, I'm I'm glad to be home. But [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're happy to be home. [INST] Patient: you know, I had to go back to the ER because of this dry hacking cough and trouble sleeping, They tested me for COVID, and that was negative. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear about your cough and sleeping troubles. [INST] Patient: But I was having I guess I was having a CHF flare so my doctor increased my laces, to twice a day. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear about your recent visit to the ER, but I'm glad to hear that you're back home. It must be a relief to be in your own space again. Is there anything you're particularly looking forward to doing now that you're home? [INST] Patient: Oh, just I would really like to get some sleep, but Since the doctor increased my lASIKs, I have to get up to go pee so often. I'm having a hard time having a good night sleep. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble sleeping. It's quite common for Lasix to increase urination as it helps your body get rid of extra fluid. However, it's important to take it as prescribed to manage your CHF symptoms. Are you still taking your Valsartan as well? [INST] Patient: Attendance. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said? [INST] Patient: I didn't do the same thing. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I'm still not clear on what you're saying. Could you please repeat it or rephrase it? [INST] Patient: I'm not saying anything. [/INST] Nurse: I see, thank you for clarifying. Let's move on to your medications. Are you still taking your Valsartan and Lasix as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. It's critical to take your medications as prescribed to manage your CHF and HTN. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time? [INST] Patient: No. But like I said, sometimes, I'll stop taking the lasex just so I can get some sleep [/INST] Nurse: I see, it's understandable that the frequent urination can disrupt your sleep. However, it's important to take Lasix as prescribed to manage your CHF symptoms. Would it be okay if I shared some strategies that might help you manage this better? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: One strategy could be to take your Lasix dose earlier in the day, if possible. This might help reduce the number of times you need to get up at night. However, it's important to discuss this with your doctor first. Would you like me to note this down for Doctor Van? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: I've noted down your concern about the Lasix disrupting your sleep and the suggestion to take it earlier in the day. I'll make sure Doctor Van is aware of this. Now, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your symptoms to help understand how you're doing at home. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest? [INST] Patient: I have some shortness of breath. I [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing shortness of breath. [INST] Patient: night. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing shortness of breath, especially at night. This is something we need to monitor closely. Have you noticed any ongoing or worsening chest pain? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're not experiencing any chest pain. Have you noticed any new or worsening dry cough? [INST] Patient: Well, yeah, the dry cough is still there. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that the dry cough is still persisting. It's important to keep an eye on this. [INST] Patient: It's a little better. But it's still there. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that the dry cough is still bothering you. It's good that it's a bit better, but we'll continue to monitor it. Have you noticed any increased swelling in your feet, ankles, stomach, or legs? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. Have you gained more than 2 pounds in the past day or 5 pounds in the past week? [INST] Patient: Well, they waived me at the ER. And \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said? [INST] Patient: I was a hundred and eighty eight pounds. But I haven't weighed myself since then because my bathroom scales broke. [/INST] Nurse: I see, it's important to monitor your weight regularly as sudden weight gain can be a sign of fluid retention. When you get a chance, could you please get your weight checked at a pharmacy or a friend's house? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I can try to do that. [/INST] Nurse: That would be very helpful. Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep? [INST] Patient: Okay. [/INST] Nurse: Lastly, have you been using more pillows at night to sleep? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. We just performed a simple CHF assessment. It's a good idea to do this at home every day. I understand that keeping track of symptoms can be complicated. Do you have any questions about how to do so? [INST] Patient: Well, I have a list here. I guess I'm supposed to check certain things every day. Is that right? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, that's correct. It's critical to monitor your symptoms daily and report any changes to your doctor. This list includes checking for shortness of breath, dry cough, swelling, weight changes, and sleeping with more pillows. It's also important to take your medications as prescribed and monitor your diet. Speaking of which, could you tell me about your recent meals? [INST] Patient: Well, they haven't been so good. You know, I don't follow the low salt diet for CHF but my cardiologist referred me to a dietitian, but I still haven't made that phone call. [/INST] Nurse: I see, it's understandable that changing dietary habits can be challenging. Would it be okay if I share some dietary recommendations that might help manage your CHF symptoms? [INST] Patient: Well, maybe if you could just have the dietitian call me, that would be health full. [/INST] Nurse: I've noted down your request for the dietitian to call you. I'll make sure Doctor Van is aware of this. In the meantime, could you tell me a bit more about your regular diet? [INST] Patient: Well, like I said, it's not very good. [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your honesty. Could you share a bit more about what you typically eat in a day? [INST] Patient: Oh, I don't know. I don't have [/INST] Nurse: I understand, it can be hard to remember everything. Could you tell me about a recent meal you had? [INST] Patient: Maybe for eggs and toast for breakfast. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's a good start. For lunch and dinner, do you usually have a specific type of meal or do you vary it? [INST] Patient: And it'll have [/INST] Nurse: ",
