[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Jon Chavez? [INST] Patient: Yes. It is. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming, Mr. Chavez. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Robert Jackson, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately? [INST] Patient: You know, I've been feeling a little scared lately.

[/INST] Nurse: I'm really sorry to hear about your weight gain and swelling in your lower legs, Mr. Chavez. It's completely normal to feel worried about these changes. I'll make sure to note this down for Doctor Jackson. Is there anything else that's been bothering you or any other symptoms you're concerned about? [INST] Patient: No. I guess not. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Chavez. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, please feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Chavez. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? [INST] Patient: Yes. And lantus time I checked, it was one twenty eight. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Chavez. A blood sugar level of 128 is a bit higher than the target range. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Chavez. One strategy could be to ensure you're eating balanced meals with a good mix of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. This can help prevent blood sugar spikes. Also, regular physical activity can help your body use insulin more effectively. Lastly, it's important to take your medications as prescribed. Do you think these strategies could work for you? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I didn't know about the exercise helping my body use until in better. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad you found that information helpful, Mr. Chavez. Regular exercise can indeed help your body use insulin more effectively, which can in turn help manage your blood sugar levels. Now, let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Blood pressure, I believe I took it yesterday was my last time. And Patient: it's between, like, one forty over [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Chavez. [INST] Patient: Seventy. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Chavez. A blood pressure reading of 140 over 70 is a bit high. It's important to keep your blood pressure under control to manage your health conditions. Would it be okay if I share some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure? [INST] Patient: Of course. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Chavez. One way to manage your blood pressure is by reducing your salt intake. This can help prevent fluid retention, which can contribute to high blood pressure. Another strategy is to maintain a healthy weight. Regular physical activity can also help manage your blood pressure. Lastly, it's important to take your medications as prescribed. Do you think these strategies could work for you? [INST] Patient: Yes. I do. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Chavez. Implementing these strategies can really help in managing your blood pressure. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results? [INST] Patient: Yeah. What are the results? [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Mr. Chavez. Your recent blood test results show that your sodium level is 145 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 3.7 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is 7.12 mmol/L, which is a bit high. This can be a sign of kidney damage. Your creatinine level is 1.0 mg/dL, which is also a bit high, and your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 55 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates some kidney damage. Lastly, your urine albumin is 121 mg/g, which is also high. This can be a sign of kidney damage. Do you have any questions about these results? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Why is it important to monitor my sodium and potassium levels. [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question, Mr. Chavez. Sodium and potassium are both electrolytes, which are minerals in your body that have an electric charge. They are important for many functions, including nerve and muscle function. In your case, it's important to monitor these levels because they can be affected by your kidney disease and the medications you're taking. If they get too high or too low, it can cause problems. Does that help clarify things? [INST] Patient: Yes. It does. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome, Mr. Chavez. I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, let's move on to your medications. You're currently taking Aspirin 81 mg daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Chavez.

[/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you don't enjoy taking your Lantus, Mr. Chavez. It's completely normal to feel this way. Would it be okay if I share some strategies that might make taking your Lantus a bit easier? [INST] Patient: Sure. Go ahead. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Chavez. One strategy could be to associate taking your Lantus with a routine activity, like brushing your teeth or reading a book. This can help make it a part of your daily routine. Another strategy could be to keep a log of when you take your Lantus. This can help you remember if you've taken it and can also be a good way to track your blood sugar levels. Lastly, it's important to remember why you're taking Lantus. It's helping to manage your blood sugar levels, which is crucial for your health. Do you think these strategies could work for you? [INST] Patient: Yes. I do. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Chavez. Implementing these strategies can really help in managing your blood sugar levels. Now, let's move on to the last medication. You're also taking Aspart 5 units three times a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: I have. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent, Mr. Chavez. Taking your Aspart as prescribed is important for managing your blood sugar levels. Now, I want to remind you that there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for patients with chronic kidney disease to take.

Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\nPatient: Low phosphorus carb controlled diet And I wanted to ask you actually what are the ways that I could follow such a restrictive diet. What food should I avoid and what food should I eat more of? [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question, Mr. Chavez. On a low phosphorus diet, you'll want to avoid foods high in phosphorus, such as dairy products, beans, lentils, nuts, and whole grains. Instead, you can focus on foods low in phosphorus, like fresh fruits and vegetables, rice, and pasta. For a carbohydrate-controlled diet, you'll want to limit foods high in carbohydrates, like bread, pasta, and sugary drinks. Instead, you can focus on lean proteins, non-starchy vegetables, and healthy fats. Does that help clarify things? [INST] Patient: Yeah. But that makes me sad because I love bread. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Chavez. It can be challenging to make changes to our diet, especially when it involves foods we love. However, these changes are important for managing your health conditions. Would it be okay if I share some strategies that might make following your diet a bit easier? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Chavez. One strategy could be to find healthier alternatives to the foods you love. For example, you could try using whole grain bread instead of white bread. Another strategy could be to focus on the foods you can eat, rather than the ones you can't. This can help you feel less restricted. Lastly, it's important to remember why you're making these changes. They're helping to manage your health conditions, which is crucial for your overall well-being.
