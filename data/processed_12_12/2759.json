        "G2": "I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question?",
        "G5": "I see. I can certainly help with that. Your recent blood tests showed that your sodium level was 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level was 4.5 mEq/L, which is also normal. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, was 6.17 mmol/L, and your creatinine level was 2.0 mg/dL. Both of these are a bit higher than the normal range, which can be common in people with kidney disease. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, was 28 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates your kidneys are not filtering as well as they should. Lastly, your urine albumin was 65 mg/g, which is also a bit high. Do you have any questions about these results?",
        "G7": "Of course. I'd be happy to go over them with you. Your sodium level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Sodium is important for nerve and muscle function. Your potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Potassium helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, to work properly. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is 6.17 mmol/L. This test measures how well your kidneys are working to remove waste from your blood. Your creatinine level is 2.0 mg/dL. Creatinine is a waste product that your kidneys filter out of your blood. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 28 mL/min/1.73m2. GFR is a test that tells us how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. Your urine albumin is 65 mg/g. This test measures the amount of albumin in your urine. Albumin is a type of protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. Do you have any questions so far?",
        "gpt4": "Your recent results show that your blood sodium (Na) level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium (K) level is 4.5 mEq/L, which is also within the normal range. Your Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), a measure of the waste product in your blood, is 6.17 mmol/L. Your creatinine, which helps us understand how your kidneys are functioning, is 2.0 mg/dL. Your Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), which tells us how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood, is 28 mL/min/1.73m2. Finally, your urine albumin, which is a type of protein, is 65 mg/g. This helps us understand if protein is being lost in your urine, which can happen in kidney disease. Do you have any specific questions about these results?"
