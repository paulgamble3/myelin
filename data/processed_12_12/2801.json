[INST] Patient: I feel okay. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay about it. It's really important to take these steps for your health. I hope this procedure gives you and your doctor the information you're looking for. Would it be alright if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our list. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy? [INST] Patient: Can you repeat that, please? [/INST] Nurse: Of course, I apologize if I wasn't clear. I'm asking about the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy. Are you clear on what you should and shouldn't eat during this time? [INST] Patient: I am. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Yes. That's fine. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or anything else you'd like to know about the day of the procedure? [INST] Patient: No. Not really. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. I'm here to help. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on? [INST] Patient: Yes. I'm ready. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. There's no need to stop this medication before your colonoscopy. Are you clear on this? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Do you have any questions about your Tylenol medication or any concerns about how it might interact with your upcoming procedure? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: I don't have any questions. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine. If any questions come up later, feel free to ask. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: No. I'm not. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on to the next topic? [INST] Patient: No. We can move on. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. It's critical to stick to this diet to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food? [INST] Patient: I love to make bread. So I love to [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful! Bread is a great choice for a low fiber diet. [INST] Patient: either toasted with cream cheese. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds delicious. Toast with cream cheese is a great choice for a low fiber diet. You can enjoy it as much as you'd like in the days leading up to your colonoscopy. Do you usually make your own bread or do you have a favorite store-bought brand? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I make my own bread. [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful! Homemade bread is always a treat. Just remember to avoid whole grains in your recipe for the next few days. This is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other favorite low fiber foods? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine. It's good to have at least one comfort food that you enjoy. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. You'll need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications? [INST] Patient: No. I'm not. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to avoid these types of supplements and medications as they can interfere with the colonoscopy preparation. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it? [INST] Patient: I feel I feel okay. [/INST] Nurse: I hear that you're feeling okay about the clear liquid diet and the GoLYTELY laxative solution. It's great that you're feeling positive about this. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all but the bowel prep can be a little bit tough. But we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine. Remember, you don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids which involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet? [INST] Patient: It's okay. I got a cover. I know what that is. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. It's important to be clear on what you can have during this time. Just to confirm, some examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. Do you have any remaining questions about the diet changes? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome. If any questions come up later, feel free to ask. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Here are a couple of tips that might help. You can drink the laxative solution cold. This can make it more palatable. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips? [INST] Patient: Sounds good. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you found the tips helpful. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If any questions come up later, feel free to ask. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking everything before your procedure. You will need to finish your laxative solution and stop everything 4 hours before your procedure. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: Yes. It does. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. It's essential to have an empty stomach for the procedure. Do you have any questions about this or is there anything else you'd like to discuss before we move on? [INST] Patient: No. I don't have any questions. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If any questions come up later, feel free to ask. I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have 2 more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything else you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. I appreciate your patience. Now, I'd like to ask if you have any signs of illness. Do you currently have any fever, chills, or muscle aches? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to be in good health for your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home after the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. My sister's picking me up. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to take you home after the procedure. Do you have any questions about the day of the procedure or is there anything else you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I don't have any other questions. [/INST] Nurse: ",
