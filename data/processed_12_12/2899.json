[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Paxton Winner? [INST] Patient: Yes. Oh, so good to hear from you. Yes. I have so many questions, and I'm so cared. Oh, gosh. And, like, you know, I tried to call hospital. They never picked up. So just have so many questions. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear from you. I'm here to help answer all your questions and make sure you're prepared for your upcoming procedure. Before we dive in, may I ask how your day is going so far? [INST] Patient: My day. I don't know. Just preparing for this a nightmare of a procedure [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed before a procedure. I'm here to help make this process as smooth as possible for you. Is there anything specific that's been bothering you today? [INST] Patient: I just have so much pain. And do you think I'll be able to move around without pain after the surgery? [/INST] Nurse: I can imagine how challenging dealing with constant pain can be. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve the pain in your knee caused by damage to the joint. After recovery, most patients experience significant pain relief and improved mobility. It's important to remember that everyone's recovery process is unique, and it may take some time to see the full benefits. But rest assured, you're in the hands of a very experienced surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens. She's performed over 1000 total knee replacements. With her expertise and your commitment to recovery, we're hopeful for a positive outcome. Speaking of which, have you thought about what you'd like to do once your knee is feeling better? [INST] Patient: Oh, gosh. Yeah. I just really want to be active and just walk without paying [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Walking without pain is a significant improvement and it's achievable. It's great to hear that you're looking forward to being more active. How are you feeling about the procedure itself? [INST] Patient: I'm scared. [/INST] Nurse: It's completely normal to feel scared before a procedure. Rest assured, you're in good hands. Your surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, is highly experienced and has a great track record. The hospital staff is also dedicated to ensuring your comfort and safety. Before we move on, do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. But I like what you said. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome. Remember, you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together? [INST] Patient: Sure. What what do you wanna talk about? [/INST] Nurse: Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: That's okay with me. Yes. Of course. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: First four sound good. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Is there anything else about the logistics that\u2019s worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Sounds pretty straightforward to me. No questions. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem straightforward to you. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed? [INST] Patient: Yes, please. Sure. [/INST] Nurse: I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance, Hydrochlorothiazide, Atorvastatin, and Ozempic. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: I actually been taking aspirin. Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's critical to note that medications like Aspirin typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I would advise you to discuss this with your doctor. Now, I notice you've also been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet? [INST] Patient: Yes, ma'am. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent. It's important to have those medications on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns? [INST] Patient: Yeah. What's the difference between Tylenol and s? Friends. [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question. Tylenol, also known as acetaminophen, is a pain reliever that can help with mild to moderate pain. Celebrex, on the other hand, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help reduce pain and inflammation. Both can be used to manage pain, but they work differently and are often used together to provide more effective pain relief. Does that help clarify things for you? [INST] Patient: So I can take both your saying? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, you can take both. They can be used together to manage your pain more effectively. However, it's important to follow the instructions provided by your doctor or pharmacist regarding the dosage and timing of these medications. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: Well, I mean, all this medications, I just, like, so scared taking them. It's so much. You know? [/INST] Nurse: I can understand why you might feel that way. It's a lot to manage. However, these medications are an important part of your recovery process. They help manage your pain and inflammation, which is crucial for your healing. Remember, your doctor has prescribed these medications because they believe they are necessary for your recovery. If you have any concerns or if the medications make you feel uncomfortable, it's important to discuss this with your doctor. Would you like to discuss anything else about your medications? [INST] Patient: All award is about my aleve, you know, [/INST] Nurse: Of course. Aleve, also known as naproxen, is a type of medication called a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). It's used to reduce pain, inflammation, and fever. It's typically taken as needed for pain, but it's important to follow the instructions on the label or from your doctor. If you have any specific questions about Aleve or how to take it, I'm here to help. [INST] Patient: Alright. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad I could provide some information about Aleve. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery. [INST] Patient: Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery. This is an important step to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub? [INST] Patient: I actually did pick it up. Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far? [INST] Patient: It's \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said? [INST] Patient: I didn't say anything. [/INST] Nurse: My apologies for the confusion. Let's proceed with the instructions for using the chlorhexidine scrub. You will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, you should take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far? [INST] Patient: Well and what is this scrubs. It's I scrub it off? [/INST] Nurse: The chlorhexidine scrub is an antiseptic that helps reduce the number of germs on your skin. It's used to clean your skin before surgery to help prevent infection. You'll apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's important to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that? [INST] Patient: Why no face? [/INST] Nurse: It's recommended to avoid using the scrub on your face because it can cause irritation, especially around the eyes. The same goes for the crotch area and hair, as these areas can be more sensitive to the scrub. After you've applied the scrub, you'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: Yes. That makes sense. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have any other questions about the chlorhexidine scrub? [INST] Patient: Not about the scrub. No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that? [INST] Patient: Yes. Ten at night. Correct? Twice, you said? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, that's correct. You'll need to use the scrub twice - once the night before your procedure and again the morning of your procedure. It's an important step to help reduce the risk of infection. Now, let's discuss the next part of your preparation, which is when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: So Patient: Can I have some water [/INST] Nurse: On the day of your procedure, you can have small sips of water up to 2 hours before your procedure. However, it's important not to have any food or drinks other than water during this time. This is to ensure your stomach is empty for the anesthesia. Does that answer your question? [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: I'm here to help. If you have any other questions or concerns about when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure, please feel free to ask. [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad that's clear. Now, I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a few more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Will I be able to move around freely? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, the goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve pain and improve mobility in your knee. After recovery, most patients experience significant pain relief and improved mobility. [INST] Patient: After the surgery? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, the goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve pain and improve mobility. After recovery, most patients experience significant pain relief and improved mobility. However, it's important to remember that everyone's recovery process is unique, and it may take some time to see the full benefits. You'll likely start physical therapy soon after your surgery to help regain strength and mobility in your knee. Does that help answer your question? [INST] Patient: But okay. It. It's okay. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness recently, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan? [INST] Patient: That's build a plan. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. It's essential to have a comfortable and safe place to recover after your procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure? [INST] Patient: Of course, girl. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. It's important to have someone to assist you as you recover, especially in the first few days after the procedure. If you need any help arranging this, please let us know. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. I Patient: So the procedure is in two days. [/INST] Nurse: ",
