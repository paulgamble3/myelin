[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Paxton Winner? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Hello Paxton, I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. How has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: It's been okay. I'm just filling kinda scared about this surgery [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling scared. It's completely normal to feel this way before a major procedure. Can you tell me more about what's making you feel scared? [INST] Patient: Well, I'm in a lot of Paxton, and I just am nervous that the knee placement is not gonna help the pain. [/INST] Nurse: I see, it's natural to have such concerns. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve the pain in the knee caused by damage to the joint. It's one of the most reliable treatments in medicine with a high success rate. After recovery, many patients find significant relief from their knee pain and are able to return to daily activities with improved mobility. Is there anything else you're worried about? [INST] Patient: Well, it's always a little scary go under general anesthesia. [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely, it's normal to feel a bit anxious about general anesthesia. However, it's important to know that anesthesia is very safe when administered by a well-trained anesthesiologist. They will monitor you closely during the procedure and recovery to ensure your safety. Is there anything else you're concerned about? [INST] Patient: Well, that's all I can think of right this minute. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine. Remember, you can ask me any questions at any time during our conversation. I'm here to help you feel as comfortable and prepared as possible for your procedure. On a lighter note, you must be looking forward to getting a new knee. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once you've recovered from your surgery? [INST] Patient: Well, I would like to just be able to go for a walk around the block without being in horrible pain. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Walking is a great way to stay active and it will be beneficial for your recovery as well. Do you have a favorite route or area you're looking forward to walking in? [INST] Patient: No. I just walk around my block. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine. Walking around your block can be a great way to enjoy some fresh air and it's a good start to getting back to your normal routine. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Yes. I was planning on that. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect, it's good to hear that you're well-prepared. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yes. That's fine. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Is there anything else about the logistics that\u2019s worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I understand. All of that just fine. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance 25 mg two times a day, Hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg two times a day, Atorvastatin 20 mg once a day, and Ozempic 2 mg once a week. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we haven't discussed, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: I take Tylenol. [/INST] Nurse: I see. Tylenol is usually safe to continue taking, but it's always best to confirm with your doctor. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed, and Celebrex 100 mg two times a day as needed for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great, you're well-prepared. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medications you're currently taking? [INST] Patient: Well, [/INST] Nurse: Yes? [INST] Patient: I stopped my aspirin Because I thought I needed to stop taking that prior to the procedure. Is that correct? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, that's correct. It's generally recommended to stop taking Aspirin about 7 days before the procedure. It's good to hear that you've already stopped. Is there anything else you're unsure about regarding your medications? [INST] Patient: I don't think so. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased a chlorhexidine scrub? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great, you're ahead of the game. The chlorhexidine scrub is used to clean your skin and reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions one by one. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect. After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's essential to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Finally, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub? [INST] Patient: No. You've explained it very well. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that? [INST] Patient: The night before in the morning up. [/INST] Nurse: Yes, that's correct. The last thing we need to discuss is when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: No. I can do that. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. It's critical to follow these instructions for your safety during the procedure. Now, I know we've covered a lot of information, but I have a few more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Yes. You know, [/INST] Nurse: Of course. What would you like to discuss? [INST] Patient: I really need to lose weight and Patient: I buy my groceries from Walmart, [/INST] Nurse: I see, managing weight can indeed be a challenge.

Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\nPatient: items that are healthy and will help me lose weight. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're interested in maintaining a healthy diet. However, as an AI, I'm not able to provide a personalized shopping list. I would recommend speaking with a dietitian or a healthcare professional who can provide you with a detailed plan tailored to your needs and preferences. In the meantime, try to focus on whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Limit processed foods and those high in sugar and sodium. Does that sound doable? [INST] Patient: Yes. That sounds durable. Do you know anything about [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question? [INST] Patient: metamucil [/INST] Nurse: Yes, Metamucil is a brand of fiber supplement that contains psyllium husk. [INST] Patient: crackers. Or fiber thin [/INST] Nurse: Metamucil Crackers and Fiber Thins are both food products that are high in fiber. They can be a good addition to your diet as they can help with digestion and weight management. However, it's important to remember that they are just one part of a balanced diet. It's always best to consult with a healthcare professional or a dietitian for personalized advice. Now, let's move on to the next question. Have you noticed any signs of illness such as fever, chills, or muscle aches recently? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I see that your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure. Is that still correct? [INST] Patient: Yes. That's correct. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. It's important to have a plan in place for when you return home. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If there's anything else you need to discuss or any questions you have, feel free to ask. [INST] Patient: I just wanna know how soon after surgery will I start feeling better. [/INST] Nurse: Recovery times can vary from person to person, but generally, you can expect to start feeling better within a few weeks after surgery. Most people are able to walk with the aid of a walker or cane within a day or two after surgery. However, it may take 3 to 6 weeks or longer to fully recover and regain strength and mobility. It's critical to follow your doctor's instructions and participate in physical therapy to aid your recovery. Does that help? [INST] Patient: Yes. I'm gonna do all those things. [/INST] Nurse: ",
