        "G2": "That's a great question. Potassium is a mineral that helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, work properly. If it's too high, it can cause serious heart problems. Your recent potassium level was 3.4 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. \n\nGFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. Your recent GFR was 58 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates that your kidneys are working at about 58% of their normal capacity. \n\nDoes this help clarify things for you?",
        "G5": "I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's discuss your medications. You're currently prescribed Apixaban 5 mg oral tablet, 10 mg once daily, Lantus 100 IU/mL prefilled pen, 10 units every night at bedtime, Aspart 100 IU/mL prefilled pen, 3 units three times a day, and Hydralazine 25 mg oral tablet, 25 mg four times a day. Are you taking these as prescribed?",
        "G7": "Of course. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test that measures how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. A GFR of 58 means your kidneys are working at about 58% of their full strength.  As for potassium, it's a mineral that helps your nerves and muscles work. Too much potassium in your blood can be dangerous. Your recent potassium level was 3.4 mEq/L, which is within the normal range.  Do you have any other questions about your lab results?",
        "gpt4": "Yes, high potassium levels can be concerning, especially for individuals with kidney disease. Your recent test shows your potassium at 3.4 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. So, you're doing well there. As for GFR, it stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test that measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. Your recent result is 58 mL/min/1.73m2, which indicates stage IIIA kidney disease. It's very important to continue monitoring this number along with your other lab results. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your lab results?"
