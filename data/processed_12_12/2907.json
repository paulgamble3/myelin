[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Eunice Shannon? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Hello Eunice, I'm calling about your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 10:00 AM. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you for taking the time to speak with me. How has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: It's been alright. But to be honest, I can't get my mind off of everything except for the surgery. [/INST] Nurse: I can imagine that it's a lot to think about. It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious before a procedure. How are you feeling about the colonoscopy specifically? [INST] Patient: That's what I'm referring to. I'm a bit nervous about that. I I fear something will go wrong. [/INST] Nurse: It's completely normal to feel nervous. Your gastroenterologist, Doctor Meredith Bailey, is highly experienced and has performed over 1500 colonoscopies. She's known for her excellent care. This procedure is a preventative screening for colon cancer, and it's a great step you're taking to take care of your health. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward? [INST] Patient: Well, what happens if it causes bleeding? [/INST] Nurse: That's a very valid concern. Bleeding can occur in some cases, but it's usually minor and stops on its own. In rare cases, if there's significant bleeding, your doctor might need to treat it. But please remember, these are rare cases. I'll make a note of your concern for your care team to review. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics on prep for your colonoscopy now? [INST] Patient: Hello? [/INST] Nurse: Hello. I'm here to help you prepare for your colonoscopy. I'll be going over some important points. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great. The preparation for a colonoscopy is crucial. You'll need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before your procedure. This includes broths, clear juices, and jello. You should avoid any red or purple colored liquids as they can interfere with the procedure. You'll also need to take a bowel prep solution, which will help clean out your colon. This is a crucial step as a clean colon allows for a more accurate procedure. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Meredith Bailey. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 9:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. I'm glad we could go over the logistics. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause. Are you ready to move forward? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Ferrous Sulfate 200 mg once a day. For your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking this medication 5 days prior to the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Do you have any questions about stopping this medication? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. These medications typically need to be stopped before a colonoscopy unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Do you have any questions about medications in general? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This includes foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and avoiding foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food? [INST] Patient: I love white rice. [/INST] Nurse: White rice is a great choice for a low fiber diet. It's easy to digest and will help prepare your colon for the procedure. Do you usually prepare it in a specific way? [INST] Patient: I'll usually add some Seaweed to it. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a tasty way to prepare it. Just remember, for the preparation of your colonoscopy, it's best to keep the dish as simple as possible. This means avoiding any additional ingredients that might be high in fiber. Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other comfort foods you're considering? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. It's essential to note that this is a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. It's all part of the preparation for your colonoscopy. Now, let's move on to discuss supplements. [INST] Patient: Request. [/INST] Nurse: ",
