        "G2": "I understand your concern. It's true that physical therapy and exercises can sometimes cause discomfort, especially in the early stages of recovery. However, they play a crucial role in helping your body adjust to the new joint and regain strength and mobility. Over time, these activities should help reduce your overall pain levels and improve your quality of life. Would you like me to go over the benefits of physical therapy and exercises in more detail?",
        "G5": "I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question?",
        "G7": "Actually, the goal of physical therapy and exercises is to help reduce pain and improve function. Initially, it may be uncomfortable, but it's designed to help you regain strength and mobility in your knee. Over time, this should help to reduce pain and improve your overall quality of life. Does that help answer your question?",
        "gpt4": "That's a valid question, Simone. Physical therapy and exercises after surgery can indeed be uncomfortable. However, they play a key role in recovery. They help strengthen the muscles around your new knee and regain range of motion in the joint. This is instrumental in helping you get back to doing the things you enjoy, such as spending more time outdoors, as you mentioned earlier. From my understanding, the discomfort from these exercises should decrease over time as you heal. May we check a few topics related to your upcoming operation?"
