[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Alex Gates? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Jami Wyatt, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately? [INST] Patient: It's been alright. Thanks. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? [INST] Patient: Nothing in particular. Just the same old. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine. Sometimes, it's nice to have a routine. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you enjoy doing in your free time? [INST] Patient: Sometimes I play soccer with my coworkers from work. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a lot of fun! Soccer is a great way to stay active. How often do you get to play with your coworkers? [INST] Patient: Like, once or twice a month. [/INST] Nurse: That's great! It's always good to have a balance of work and play. Before we move on, is there anything you've been feeling concerned about health-wise that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent. Could you share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was? [INST] Patient: One twelve. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's important to keep your blood sugar levels in check. Would you be open to some suggestions on how to manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. One strategy is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, and incorporating a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Another strategy is regular physical activity, which can help your body use insulin more effectively. Lastly, taking your prescribed medications as directed is crucial in managing your blood sugar levels. Do these suggestions sound manageable to you? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Well, is my number normal? [/INST] Nurse: Your blood sugar level of 120 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes, which is usually under 120. However, it's not too far off. With the strategies we discussed, you should be able to bring it down. Regular monitoring and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can really help. Now, let's talk about your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was? [INST] Patient: Well, hold on. I didn't say one twenty. I said one twelve. [/INST] Nurse: I apologize for the misunderstanding. A blood sugar level of 112 is within the target range for people with diabetes. That's a good reading. Let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was? [INST] Patient: I think it was this morning. It was one forty four over eighty five. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. Your blood pressure reading of 144 over 85 is a bit high. High blood pressure can put extra strain on your kidneys and heart. Would you be open to some suggestions on how to manage your blood pressure? [INST] Patient: I guess. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. One way to manage your blood pressure is by reducing your salt intake. This can be done by eating less processed foods and not adding extra salt to your meals. Another strategy is regular physical activity, which can help lower your blood pressure. Lastly, taking your prescribed medications as directed is crucial in managing your blood pressure. Do these suggestions sound manageable to you? [INST] Patient: I guess, [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your willingness to consider these suggestions. They can really help in managing your blood pressure. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results? [INST] Patient: Yeah. What does GFR mean and how is it measured? [/INST] Nurse: Great question. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A lower GFR can be a sign that your kidneys aren't working as well as they should be. Your GFR is 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which is a bit lower than normal. This is something your doctor will continue to monitor. Does that help clarify things? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, let's move on to your medications. You're currently taking Valsartan 40 mg once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: How do I avoid going into dialysis? [/INST] Nurse: That's a very important question. The best way to avoid needing dialysis is to manage your kidney disease effectively. This includes taking your prescribed medications as directed, maintaining a healthy diet, staying active, and controlling your blood sugar and blood pressure. Regular check-ups with your doctor are also crucial. Would you like more information on any of these strategies? [INST] Patient: Not right now. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's review your medications. You're currently taking Valsartan 40 mg once daily.

Now, let's move on to the next medication. You're also taking Lantus 15 units two times a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent. Lantus is crucial in managing your blood sugar levels. Now, let's discuss the next medication. You're taking Hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. Hydrochlorothiazide is important for managing your blood pressure. Now, let's move on to the next medication. You're also taking Aspart 5 units three times a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes.

Do you ever have trouble taking your medication on time? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's fantastic. You're doing a great job managing your medications. Just a reminder, there are certain medications and supplements that aren't safe for patients with chronic kidney disease to take. Always talk to your doctor before starting any new medications or supplements, including over the counter drugs. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: Hello? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, I'm here. Do you have any questions about the medications or supplements that are safe for you to take? [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your response. Could you please repeat it? [INST] Patient: I said, no. I don't have any questions. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's talk about your diet. Could you tell me about your recent meals? [INST] Patient: Yeah. So I'm on the dash diet. I'm trying to eat healthier. So I've been eating a lot of valid. Specifically, I love using the Wishbone Italian style dress thing. Can you tell me how much salt is in it? [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear you're making an effort to eat healthier. The Wishbone Italian Style Dressing contains about 300 mg of sodium per serving, which is about 2 tablespoons. That's quite a bit of sodium. Would you be open to some suggestions on how to reduce your sodium intake? [INST] Patient: I guess so. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. One way to reduce your sodium intake is by using less dressing. You could also try making your own dressing at home with ingredients like olive oil, vinegar, and herbs, which are lower in sodium. Another strategy is to choose fresh fruits and vegetables over processed foods, as they are naturally low in sodium. Lastly, try to limit your intake of high-sodium snacks like chips and crackers. Do these suggestions sound manageable to you? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Remember, these changes can really help in managing your blood pressure and kidney health.

Quitting smoking is a big step, and it's important for your overall health, especially with your chronic conditions. Have you ever considered quitting smoking?
