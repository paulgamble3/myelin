So So tell me, [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your openness. It sounds like you're really looking forward to getting your new knee and getting back to doing the things you love without pain. Is that correct? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Yeah. You got it. [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful to hear. With your new knee, do you have any specific activities or hobbies you're excited to get back to? [INST] Patient: Well, as I said in my opening message. Heck yeah. I'm ready to do some hiking, biking, swimming, you know, walking, running. I wanna do it all. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds fantastic.

[/INST] Nurse: It's completely normal to feel a mix of emotions before a procedure like this. It's a big step, but a positive one towards improving your quality of life. Before we move on, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Questions or concerns. Patient: Yeah. Do you think do you think I'll be able to move to move freely after the surgery. [/INST] Nurse: Yes, that's the goal of a total knee replacement. The surgery is designed to relieve pain and help you regain function in your knee. Most people experience significant improvement in their knee function after recovery. However, it's important to remember that recovery can take time and physical therapy will be a crucial part of regaining your mobility. Would you like to discuss anything else before we move on to some logistics? [INST] Patient: Well, also, like, the question, like, do you think my pain will prove after the surgery? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, the surgery is intended to alleviate the pain caused by your damaged knee. After recovery, most people experience significant pain relief and improved mobility. However, it's important to remember that everyone's recovery process is unique and it may take some time to fully realize these benefits. Is there anything else you'd like to know before we discuss some logistics? [INST] Patient: And how long is the recovery usually? [/INST] Nurse: Recovery times can vary, but generally, you can expect to start seeing improvements within a few weeks after surgery. However, it may take several months to fully recover and regain your strength and mobility. Physical therapy will play a crucial role in your recovery. Does that help? [INST] Patient: Well, I guess, several months, Oh, okay. Well, Okay. I think yeah. I I mean, I get it. I get it. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad we could discuss that. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together? [INST] Patient: Yeah. What's up? Take it taking me on take me on this journey. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Well, yeah, I have this marks months now. So [/INST] Nurse: Great, it's good to hear that you're well-prepared. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Sound good. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that. Before we move on to discuss your medications, I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to proceed. Can we move on? [INST] Patient: Yes. Let's move on. Let's move on. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance, Hydrochlorothiazide, Atorvastatin, and Ozempic. There are no changes to these medications before your surgery. Are you still taking these medications as prescribed? [INST] Patient: I am. Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: I I stopped aspirin. I did not know you needed to stop, though. [/INST] Nurse: That's correct. [INST] Patient: I did stop, though. [/INST] Nurse: That's great. It's essential to stop taking Aspirin before your surgery. Do you have any questions about this or any other medication? [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: I see that you've also been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet? [INST] Patient: I got it all picked up. Yep. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent. You're well-prepared. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns? [INST] Patient: Block centers, basically. I'm very curious about the block centers. Like, Why do we need to stop them? I've heard it so many times, but honestly, I still don't understand why. [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question. Aspirin and other blood thinners are usually stopped before surgery because they can increase the risk of bleeding. During surgery, it's important to avoid excessive bleeding to ensure a safe and successful procedure. Does that help clarify things? [INST] Patient: In, what do you mean by bleeding? [/INST] Nurse: I mean that these medications can make it easier for you to bleed, or make bleeding more severe if it does occur. This is because they work by thinning your blood, which can be helpful in preventing blood clots, but not ideal during surgery. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: Like, I I don't understand. Bleeding What do you mean? [/INST] Nurse: I apologize if my explanation wasn't clear. When we say bleeding, we mean any loss of blood, including internal bleeding, which can occur during surgery. Blood thinners can make it harder for the blood to clot, which can lead to more bleeding. That's why they're usually stopped before surgery. Does that make more sense? [INST] Patient: Guess so. I guess so. It makes more sense. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's move on to discuss how to prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub? [INST] Patient: Of course, darling. Kidding. I'm such a type of contract, you know, I've got it one time ago. [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful to hear. You're well-prepared. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. After taking a normal shower and turning the water off, does that sound good so far? [INST] Patient: You bet. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's essential to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that? [INST] Patient: What's the foil? I'm sorry. I need a scrub, so I can scrub it anywhere. [/INST] Nurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear. [INST] Patient: I don't understand. [/INST] Nurse: I apologize if that wasn't clear. The chlorhexidine scrub is an antiseptic that helps reduce the risk of infection. It's meant to be used on your skin, but not on your face, hair, or crotch area. These areas can be more sensitive and may not need the scrub. Does that make more sense? [INST] Patient: Okay. Well, Whenever I'm taking shower, I'm just they can sell, like, a regular Paxton, but I guess [/INST] Nurse: Yes, that's correct. You'll use the chlorhexidine scrub after your regular shower. After applying it to a washcloth and gently scrubbing your skin, you'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes, then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. Can you remember to do that? [INST] Patient: You know? [/INST] Nurse: Yes. You're correct. You should continue to cleanse your body as you normally would during your shower. The chlorhexidine scrub is an additional step to help prepare your skin for surgery. After applying the scrub, you'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes, then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. Can you remember to do that? [INST] Patient: I mean, ma'am, I've taken out before my life. So I think I got it from here. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. I'm glad you're feeling confident about this. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub or the process of using it? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: Well, can you elaborate? On, like, what's the reason of not eating? [/INST] Nurse: Certainly. [INST] Patient: What's Patient: Why? [/INST] Nurse: That's a good question. The reason is to prevent any food or liquid from being accidentally inhaled during your anesthesia. This could cause serious complications. That's why it's important to follow this instruction very strictly. Does that help clarify things? [INST] Patient: Oh, Oh, yeah. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad that makes sense. Now, I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a few more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Carry on. Carry on. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you. I'm glad to hear that.

It's critical to have someone to assist you after the procedure. If there's ever a change in your plans, please let us know.
