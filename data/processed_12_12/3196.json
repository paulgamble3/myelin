[/INST] Nurse: My apologies for the confusion. You mentioned you're on a low salt, low carb diet. That's a great start. As for other dietary changes, it's important to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. However, it's always best to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized advice. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics to check on how you're doing? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you.
