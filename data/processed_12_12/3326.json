[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Renee Spence? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, Ms. Spence. I'm calling to check in with you about your upcoming total knee replacement surgery on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. It's a quick call to ensure you have everything you need before the procedure. How are you doing today? [INST] Patient: Alright. Thanks just a little bit. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Spence. I understand you might be a little nervous about the surgery, but I'm here to help you through the process. Let's start by reviewing a few logistical items, and then we'll discuss your medications. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Let's begin with the logistics. On the day of your surgery, you'll need to arrive at O'Connor Hospital by 8:00 AM. The surgery is scheduled for 9:00 AM. You'll be going to the first floor of O'Connor Hospital to check in. Does that work for you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Ms. Spence, before we move on to medications, I want to ensure you have everything you need for your recovery. Have you picked up the Tylenol 1000 mg prescribed for after the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Now, let's talk about your medications. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day. You'll need to stop taking that medication seven days before your procedure. That means you'll need to stop taking it on August 6th. Have you stopped taking it already? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Ms. Spence, I also noticed you're taking Atorvastatin 40 mg and Celebrex 100 mg. You can continue taking those medications as prescribed unless your doctor instructed you otherwise. Are you taking any other medications we should know about? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Now, let's talk about the chlorhexidine scrub. This is a special soap that you'll need to use to prepare your skin for surgery and reduce the risk of infection. Have you purchased the scrub yet? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Ms. Spence, I'll walk you through the instructions for using the scrub. The night before and the morning of your procedure, you'll need to take a shower and use the scrub on a wet, clean washcloth. Gently scrub yourself from the neck down, avoiding your face, hair, and crotch area. You'll need to rub gently for 5 minutes, then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. Does that sound good so far? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Ms. Spence, I want to ensure you remember to do the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Can you commit to doing that? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Now, let's talk about when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about that? [INST] Patient: Know. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: I apologize, Ms. Spence, I didn't quite catch that. Could you repeat your response? [INST] Patient: I said no. [/INST] Nurse: Okay, no problem. Now, let's talk about logistics verification. Does the patient have any signs of illness? [INST] Patient: The patient? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, Ms. Spence. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or muscle aches recently? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Ms. Spence, your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure. Have you made arrangements for a ride home and someone to stay with you after the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Ms. Spence, it's essential that you have someone available to stay with you after the procedure, as you'll need assistance with basic tasks for a few days. Is the person who'll be staying with you able to help you with things like getting out of bed, using the bathroom, and taking medication? [INST] Patient: No. But I can ask someone else. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Spence. It's important to have someone who can assist you. If you need help finding someone, we can provide resources for you. Just let us know. Now, that was all the topics for today. But do you have any questions or concerns? [INST] Patient: Yeah. This was a little bit overwhelming, and I don't think I want a surgery anymore. [/INST] Nurse: I completely understand, Ms. Spence. It's normal to feel overwhelmed before a procedure. If you're having second thoughts about the surgery, it's important to discuss them with your surgeon. They can address any concerns you have and help you make an informed decision. Would you like me to arrange a call with your surgeon for you? [INST] Patient: I guess that's fine. [/INST] Nurse: ",
