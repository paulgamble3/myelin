        "G2": "That's great, Pete. Regular exercise is important for managing your conditions. Walking and weightlifting are both good options. If it's okay with you, I'd like to provide some recommendations about improving your exercise routine in a CHF appropriate manner. Would that be alright?",
        "G5": "That's a good start. It's important to stay active, especially with your conditions. Would you like me to provide some suggestions to help you stay within your exercise guidelines?",
        "G7": "It sounds like you're staying active, which is great! How long are your walks and what kind of weight lifting do you do?",
        "gpt4": "That's great to hear, Pete. It sounds like you have quite an active routine. Going for bike rides and taking long walks can help keep your heart muscle strong, which is beneficial in managing your CHF. Free weight lifting can also help, but it's important to ensure that you don't strain yourself. It seems like your exercise routine is in line with what's usually recommended for someone with your conditions, which is moderate intensity aerobic activities, such as walking or cycling, about 3 to 5 times per week. Always remember to stay hydrated and rest if you need to. Is there a specific exercise you enjoy most? Would you like to discuss any modifications or additions to your routine?"
