So let's go ahead and move forward. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Let's start with your new medications. Have you been able to pick up your Lasix 20 mg oral tablets from the pharmacy? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. And how have you been taking your Lasix 20 mg tablets? [INST] Patient: Just like the bottle says, I've been doing the twenty milligrams, twice a day. [/INST] Nurse: That's great.

[/INST] Nurse: You're doing a great job. Now, let's briefly discuss your existing medications. Are you still taking your Potassium and Metoprolol tablets? [INST] Patient: Yes.

[/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. It sounds like you're well-prepared. Now, let's talk about your diet. Can you tell me about your recent meals? [INST] Patient: Well, it's always a challenge.

Fluid intake is not to exceed 1.5 to 2 Liters per day. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Based on what you've shared about your diet, it seems like you're doing well. Just remember to keep an eye on the sodium content in your food, especially when eating out.
