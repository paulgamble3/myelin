        "G2": "Alright, Mr. Koroleva. Let's move on to the next topic. You'll need to follow a clear liquid diet the day before your colonoscopy. This includes broths, clear juices, and gelatin desserts. You should avoid anything that is red or purple. Does that make sense?",
        "G5": "Alright, Mr. Koroleva. I'm glad to hear that. I'm here to ensure you have all the information you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. Before we begin, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss?",
        "G7": "Alright. Now, I'd like to go over the prep for your colonoscopy. It's very important to follow the prep instructions to ensure the procedure goes smoothly. Do you have any questions before we start?",
        "gpt4": "Great, let's talk about the preparation then. It's important that the colon is entirely empty for the procedure. To do this, we'll be providing you with a prescription for a colonoscopy prep kit, which includes a special drink and laxative. You'll need to start this preparation the day before your procedure. Don't worry, we'll provide instructions on how to use it. I recommend that you stay at home and near a restroom once you start the preparation as the laxatives will make you go to the bathroom frequently. Does that make sense to you, Mr. Koroleva?"
