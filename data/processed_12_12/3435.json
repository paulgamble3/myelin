Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. [INST] Patient: How about just going over the colonoscopy details? [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Mr. Valenzuela. Your colonoscopy will be performed by Doctor Meredith Bailey, who is an excellent gastroenterologist. She has performed over 1500 colonoscopies and is highly experienced. The procedure itself is a way to examine the inner lining of your large intestine. It helps to detect any issues such as inflammation, polyps, or cancer. During the procedure, a thin, flexible tube called a colonoscope is used to examine the colon. The procedure is safe, but like any medical procedure, there are some risks involved. These include bleeding, infection, or a tear in the colon, but these are rare. There are no alternate courses of treatment or non-treatment that we can discuss at this time, as the colonoscopy is the most effective way to diagnose the cause of your symptoms. I hope this information is helpful. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the procedure? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: ",
