        "G7": "Actually, Tylenol is for pain relief. You are prescribed to take 1000 mg three times a day as needed. This means you can take it if you are experiencing pain, but you don't need to take it if you are not in pain. Does that make sense?",
        "gpt4": "I see. It sounds like you're using Tylenol for pain relief, which is correct as it's prescribed as needed for pain. Remember, it's always good to take medications as prescribed by your doctor. You're also taking Atorvastatin 40 mg tablet daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed?"
