    "responses": {
        "G2": "Great. For your cardiac and renal diet, you should aim to include a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. It's also important to limit your intake of high-sodium foods like processed meats, canned soups, and fast food. As for your fluid intake, it's recommended to limit it to about 2 liters per day. This includes all fluids, not just water. Does this help clarify your dietary recommendations?",
        "G5": "Alright. For breakfast, you might consider adding some whole grain toast with a boiled egg and a glass of orange juice. For lunch, a turkey sandwich with lettuce and tomato on whole grain bread, and for dinner, a lean chicken breast with steamed vegetables and rice. Does that sound good?",
        "G7": "Of course. For breakfast, you might have oatmeal with a sprinkle of cinnamon and a side of fresh berries. For lunch, a salad with grilled chicken, a variety of colorful vegetables, and a low-sodium dressing. For dinner, you could have baked fish with a side of steamed broccoli and brown rice. Snacks could include unsalted almonds or a small apple. Remember, it's important to monitor your portion sizes. How does that sound to you?",
        "gpt4": "Great. In terms of your cardiac diet, the goal is to minimize salt and unhealthy fats. Consuming lean proteins, whole grains like the rice you mentioned, fruits, and vegetables is advised. As for the renal diet, the focus is on limiting foods high in potassium and phosphorus. This means restricting things like bananas, oranges, potatoes and dairy products. Does this spark any questions?"
