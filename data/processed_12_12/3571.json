[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Paxton Winner? [INST] Patient: It's Paxton. [/INST] Nurse: Hello Paxton, I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Pretty good time to talk. [/INST] Nurse: Great. I'm glad to hear that. How has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: My day's been good. Alright. I'm just really freaking out freaking out about the procedure coming up in two days. I am just really, really, really Gosh. My mind is racing. I don't know where to find piece right now. You know, just really, really I don't know where to begin. I just feel extremely I feel like I'm walking into something that I shouldn't, but then I know that I Jude. And then that gosh. See, like, I'm all over the place, and I don't know what to say. Extremely disoriented. [/INST] Nurse: I can hear that you're feeling a bit overwhelmed. It's completely normal to feel this way before a procedure. You're not alone in this. I'm here to help you through it. Is there anything specific you're worried about that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Just, like, honestly, I'm afraid that knee is not gonna get better. Do you think my team will improve after the surgery? [/INST] Nurse: It's a very common concern. [INST] Patient: Two. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question? [INST] Patient: Do you think the pain my pain will get better after the surgery. [/INST] Nurse: Yes. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve pain and help you regain function in your knee. Most people experience significant pain relief and improved mobility after recovery. It's critical to remember that everyone's recovery is different, but your healthcare team, including Doctor Stevens, will be there to support you every step of the way. Is there anything else you're concerned about? [INST] Patient: No. No and yes. Yes and no. Will I be able to move around after the surgery without pain. [/INST] Nurse: After the surgery, you will likely experience some pain as you heal. However, the pain you feel should be manageable with the medications your doctor will prescribe. Over time, as you recover and go through physical therapy, the pain will decrease and your mobility will improve. It's important to remember that this is a process and it will take some time to fully recover. Would you like to discuss anything else about the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Of course. What else would you like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Yeah. How long is it? [/INST] Nurse: The actual surgery typically takes about 1 to 2 hours. However, the preparation before the surgery and the recovery time immediately after can add a few more hours to your hospital stay on the day of the procedure. After the surgery, you can expect to stay in the hospital for a few days, depending on your progress. Does that help? [INST] Patient: Yes. It helps. So okay. So typically one to two hours. Gotcha. And preparation makes sense. And how long is the recovery [/INST] Nurse: The recovery time varies from person to person, but generally, you can expect to use a walker or crutches for about 6 weeks. After that, you'll likely transition to a cane for a few more weeks. Full recovery can take anywhere from 3 to 6 months, but it's important to remember that everyone's recovery is unique. Your healthcare team will provide you with a more personalized timeline based on your progress. Does that answer your question? [INST] Patient: It does. Yes. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to ask, have you been thinking about what you might like to do once your knee is feeling better? [INST] Patient: Oh, gosh. Just, you know, simply just walking. Freeway. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat that? [INST] Patient: Just walking freely. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds wonderful. [INST] Patient: Freely walking simply. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\nPatient: I just wanna walk without paying. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. Walking without pain is a significant improvement and it's something you can look forward to. Now, let's move on to discuss some logistics about your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: That okay. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yes, ma'am. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect. Is there anything else about the logistics that\u2019s worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. What time should I arrive to the hospital? [/INST] Nurse: You should aim to arrive at the hospital around 1 hour before your procedure, so for your 9:00 AM procedure, you should plan to arrive at 8:00 AM. This will give you enough time to check in and prepare for your surgery. Does that help? [INST] Patient: That help. Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed? [INST] Patient: Yes, please. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Jardiance, Hydrochlorothiazide, Atorvastatin, and Ozempic. Have you stopped taking your Aspirin 81 mg, which you were instructed to stop 7 days before the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. I did. [/INST] Nurse: That's great. It's important to follow these instructions for your surgery. Do you have any questions about these medications or why you needed to stop the Aspirin? [INST] Patient: Well, something about blood. [/INST] Nurse: Yes, that's correct. Aspirin is a type of medication known as a blood thinner. It's usually stopped before surgery to reduce the risk of excessive bleeding during the procedure. Are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of? [INST] Patient: I'm not taking any, so I'm good. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to avoid those medications unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Now, I notice you've also been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet? [INST] Patient: I did. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent. It's important to have those on hand for after your procedure. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medication-related concerns? [INST] Patient: I don't know. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to discuss how to prepare your skin for surgery. This is an important step to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased a chlorhexidine scrub? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great. You'll need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far? [INST] Patient: I mean, going. [/INST] Nurse: Great. [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: After you've turned the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that? [INST] Patient: Go on [/INST] Nurse: After you've turned the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's important to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that? [INST] Patient: Hello? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, I'm here. After you've turned the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's important to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. After you've scrubbed gently for 5 minutes, you'll rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub? [INST] Patient: No. Pretty clear. Put pretty pretty true. Trade up. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that? [INST] Patient: I got it. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: No questions. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that. Now, I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a few more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Pretty you already answered all my questions. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to ask if you've been experiencing any signs of illness. Do you have a fever, chills, or muscle aches? [INST] Patient: No, ma'am. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to stay as healthy as possible leading up to your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan? [INST] Patient: Still the plan. Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. It's essential to have a safe and comfortable place to recover after your procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. It's essential to have someone to assist you as you recover. If you didn't have someone, you would still have time to arrange it, but it's good that you've already taken care of this. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your upcoming procedure? [INST] Patient: I'm pretty through. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: ",
