Could you please provide your date of birth for verification purposes? [INST] Patient: March second nineteen fifty five. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming. I'm calling about your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you for your time. How has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: It's been very wet very good so far. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're having a good day, even with the wet weather. As we move forward, I'd like to know how you're feeling about your upcoming colonoscopy procedure. [ [INST] Patient: And I'm just ready to get it [/INST] Nurse: It's completely normal to feel ready to get the procedure done. It's a step towards taking care of your health.

[/INST] Nurse: I see, you're a veteran at this. It's great that you're familiar with the process. Do you have any specific concerns or questions about this upcoming procedure that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I don't have any questions at all. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, if any questions come up during our conversation, feel free to ask at any time.

[INST] Patient: You know, again, just really ready to get it over with. [/INST] Nurse: I can appreciate that sentiment. It's great that you're taking this step to take care of your health.

Are you clear on the dietary restrictions you need to follow before your colonoscopy? [INST] Patient: Can I ask you a question first? [/INST] Nurse: Of course, you're welcome to ask any questions. What would you like to know? [INST] Patient: Well, what is colorectal cancer? [/INST] Nurse: Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the colon or rectum. It usually starts as a growth called a polyp in the inner lining of the colon or rectum. Over time, some polyps can turn into cancer. That's why colonoscopies are important - they can detect these polyps in their early stages, when they're easier to remove and treat. Does that help clarify things for you? [INST] Patient: And what are the common risk factors for developing it? [/INST] Nurse: Common risk factors for colorectal cancer include age, family history of the disease, a diet high in red and processed meats, and a sedentary lifestyle. It's also more common in individuals who are overweight or obese, smoke, or have type 2 diabetes. Regular screenings, like the one you're having, can help detect any potential issues early. Do you have any other questions before we move on to discussing the procedure? [INST] Patient: No, ma'am. Thank you so much.

I will be there. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect, punctuality is key for these procedures. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yes. It does. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Is there anything else about the logistics that\u2019s worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, if any concerns come up later, don't hesitate to bring them up. I'm going to move on to talk about your medications, but I want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. Can we proceed? [INST] Patient: Yes, ma'am. [/INST] Nurse: Great, let's discuss your medications. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Tylenol 500 mg, with a dosage of 1000 mg TID. There's no need to stop this medication before your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this medication? [INST] Patient: No. I've been taking Tylenol for a while with it off the email. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that last part. Could you [INST] Patient: So yeah.

[INST] Patient: No. I do not. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet. This means you can eat foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and you should avoid foods like whole grains, nuts, seeds, and most fruits and vegetables. Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet? [INST] Patient: No. I understand. [/INST] Nurse: Great, it's important to stick to this diet to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food? [INST] Patient: Pasta. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: Pasta is a great choice for a low fiber diet. Do you have a favorite pasta dish that you're planning to enjoy during this time?

Do you have any other questions about the diet or any other foods you're considering? [INST] Patient: No. No questions about diet at all. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to discuss supplements.

[INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to avoid those supplements and medications to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy.

[INST] Patient: A little anxious, but, again, I've done it before. Four. I'm just ready to get it over with. [/INST] Nurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. [/INST] Nurse: I hear you, it's quite common to feel a bit anxious about this part. But remember, you've done it before and you know what to expect. Most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the preparation? [INST] Patient: No. I do not. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, if any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet? [INST] Patient: I don't [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your response? [INST] Patient: I don't have any questions since I've done it before.

Just to confirm, this includes water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. If any questions come up later, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to the other main step to remember, which is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution.
