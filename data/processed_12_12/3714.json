[INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with the first item on our checklist. Are you clear on the dietary restrictions leading up to your procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, it's important to follow those dietary guidelines for the best results. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way.

Do you have any questions about medications? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Let's smoothly transition to the diet preparation for your colonoscopy. Starting today, you'll want to begin eating a low fiber diet.

Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. It's important to stick to this diet to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy? [INST] Patient: White bread chicken, [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a good choice. White bread and chicken are both low in fiber and should be fine to eat. Do you usually prepare it in a specific way? [INST] Patient: Just grill it. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds delicious. Grilled chicken with white bread can be a comforting meal. It's one of those rare times when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you have any other questions about the diet or anything else you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Let's move on to the next topic. You will also need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to avoid these supplements and medications to ensure the best results from your colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Let's move on to the instructions for the clear liquid diet and GoLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it? [INST] Patient: I'm okay. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay about it. It's true that most people say the procedure itself is no problem at all, but the bowel prep can be a bit tough. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions or concerns about this part of the prep? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. You don't have to do anything just yet. But you'll need to start your bowel prep 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are and you can tell me what questions you have about the diet? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's important to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about these diet changes? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. The other main step to remember is drinking the laxative solution the night before your procedure. You'll need to start drinking the first half of your GoLYTELY laxative solution around 6PM. And then wake up early the morning of the procedure to finish drinking the second half of the solution. Would you like some tips on making the bowel prep easier? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Here are a couple of tips that might help. You can drink the laxative solution cold, which some people find makes it easier to drink. You can also drink the solution through a straw to help it go down easier. What do you think about these tips? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Sounds good. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome. I'm glad you found the tips helpful. Do you have any questions about the bowel prep or anything else you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Now. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves.
