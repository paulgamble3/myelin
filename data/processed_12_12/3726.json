[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Cortez Wiggins? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming, Mr. Wiggins. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Maria Smith, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately? [INST] Patient: I'm doing pretty good today, actually. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Wiggins. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? [INST] Patient: Well, I'm hoping the weather clears up a little bit, and I can take my dog for a lot. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a lovely plan, Mr. Wiggins. What kind of dog do you have? [INST] Patient: She's a chorkey [/INST] Nurse: A chorkey, that's a unique breed! What's her name? [INST] Patient: Her name is sweet pea. [/INST] Nurse: Sweet Pea, what a lovely name! It must be great to have her as a companion. Before we move on, is there anything you've been feeling concerned about health-wise? [INST] Patient: Well, yeah, that's chronic kidney disease is to worry on a daily basis. So what does it mean that I'm a stage two. How many stages are there in kidney disease? [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your question, Mr. Wiggins. There are five stages of kidney disease, with stage 1 being the mildest and stage 5 being the most severe. Stage 2, which you're in, means that your kidneys are not working at their full potential, but they're still functioning reasonably well. It's important to manage your health to prevent progression to later stages. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Oh, wow. I didn't know that. [/INST] Nurse: Yes, Mr. Wiggins, it's important to understand the stages of kidney disease. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. Are you okay if we go over a few topics related to your health now? [INST] Patient: Go ahead. [/INST] Nurse: There are five stages of kidney disease, Mr. Wiggins. Stage 2 is an early stage where there's some kidney damage with a mild decrease in kidney function. It's important to manage your health to prevent progression to later stages. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Well, let's get through the conversation here. I'll probably have more as we go along [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Wiggins. I'm here to help. If it's okay with you, I'd like to go over a few topics related to your health. Is that alright? [INST] Patient: when, I guess, I don't really scares me thinking I'm gonna have to do dialysis. Do my labs indicate that I need start dialysis soon, or do I still have some time? [/INST] Nurse: I can understand your concerns, Mr. Wiggins. Your current lab results indicate that you're in Stage II CKD, which means there's some kidney damage and a mild decrease in kidney function. However, this is an early stage and with proper management, it's possible to slow down the progression of the disease. Dialysis is typically not needed until much later stages, when kidney function is significantly reduced. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics to check on how you're doing? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you, Mr. Wiggins. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? [INST] Patient: Yes. I do that. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent, Mr. Wiggins. Could you please share your last blood sugar reading at home? [INST] Patient: It's one twenty eight. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Wiggins. A blood sugar level of 128 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: Yes. Go ahead. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Wiggins. One strategy to help manage your blood sugar levels is to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating regular meals and snacks throughout the day, and incorporating a variety of foods such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Another strategy is regular physical activity, which can help your body use insulin more effectively. Lastly, it's important to take your prescribed medications, like Metformin, as directed by your doctor. Do you have any questions about these strategies? [INST] Patient: Well, [/INST] Nurse: Yes, Mr. Wiggins? [INST] Patient: I am currently trying to do all those things. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Wiggins. It sounds like you're already taking steps to manage your blood sugar levels. Keep up the good work! Now, let's talk about your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and do you remember what the reading was? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I took it yes your day. Let me look at my notes here. [/INST] Nurse: Of course, take your time, Mr. Wiggins. It's critical to have accurate information. [INST] Patient: Yeah. It was it was one twenty over seventy five. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Wiggins. [INST] Patient: Is that good? [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Wiggins. A blood pressure reading of 120/75 is within the normal range, which is good news. It's critical to keep monitoring your blood pressure regularly. Would it be okay if I share some suggestions about managing blood pressure? [INST] Patient: Yep. Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Wiggins. A blood pressure reading of 120/75 is within the normal range, which is good. It's critical to keep monitoring your blood pressure regularly. Would it be okay if I share some suggestions about managing blood pressure? [INST] Patient: Sure. Go ahead. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Wiggins. One way to manage blood pressure is by reducing your salt intake. This can be done by eating less processed foods and not adding extra salt to your meals. Another strategy is regular physical activity, which can help lower your blood pressure. Lastly, it's important to take your prescribed medications, like Tylenol, as directed by your doctor. Do you have any questions about these strategies? [INST] Patient: No. I tried to reduce my salt intake. I don't Perfectly [/INST] Nurse: That's a great start, Mr. Wiggins. Reducing salt intake can have a positive impact on your blood pressure. Keep up the good work! [INST] Patient: But Patient: I also try to eat vegan, and low carb. [/INST] Nurse: That's a great start, Mr. Wiggins. [INST] Patient: So [/INST] Nurse: That's a great start, Mr. Wiggins. Reducing salt intake and following a healthy diet can indeed help manage your blood pressure. [INST] Patient: Are those good diets to be on? [/INST] Nurse: It sounds like you're making some positive changes to your diet, Mr. Wiggins. A vegan and low-carb diet can be beneficial for managing your conditions, but it's important to ensure you're getting all the necessary nutrients. It's always a good idea to discuss any major dietary changes with your healthcare provider. Now, I noticed some recent blood tests and urine labs in your chart. Do you have any questions about these results? [INST] Patient: Yeah. You know, I was looking at those on my phone Patient: and it said something about [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Mr. Wiggins. Could you please tell me which specific result you're referring to? [INST] Patient: my potassium And I wanna know [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Mr. Wiggins. [INST] Patient: what levels are good for potassium. Poles are good for sodium. [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question, Mr. Wiggins. Potassium is an important mineral that helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, work properly. The normal range for potassium in your blood is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Sodium, on the other hand, is an electrolyte that helps regulate the amount of water in your body. The normal range for sodium is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Your recent lab results show a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L and a sodium level of 137 mEq/L, which are both within the normal ranges. Does that help clarify things for you? [INST] Patient: Yes. Yeah. So I don't have to go get dialysis, like, tomorrow. Right? [/INST] Nurse: No, Mr. Wiggins, your current lab results do not indicate that you need to start dialysis. As I mentioned earlier, you're in Stage II CKD, which means there's some kidney damage and a mild decrease in kidney function. However, this is an early stage and with proper management, it's possible to slow down the progression of the disease. Dialysis is typically not needed until much later stages, when kidney function is significantly reduced. Now, let's move on to discussing your medications. You're currently prescribed Metformin 500 mg once a day and Tylenol 500 mg, up to 1000 mg three times a day as needed. Have you been taking these medications as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. I do have a question on the Tylenol Can I take that frequently when I'm in pain or how many milligrams do I need to take like, to be under the good limit for a day? [/INST] Nurse: That's a good question, Mr. Wiggins. The maximum recommended dose of Tylenol for adults is 3,000 mg per day. However, your doctor has prescribed a maximum of 1000 mg three times a day as needed for pain. It's critical not to exceed this limit to avoid potential liver damage. If you find that you're needing to take Tylenol frequently, it's a good idea to discuss this with your doctor. Does that answer your question? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I think so. And then something else I wanted you to maybe ask the doctor for me Surgeries. I have a lot of pain Wondering if he could prescribe me some tramadol. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear about your pain, Mr. Wiggins. It's essential to manage it effectively. However, as an AI, I don't have the ability to prescribe medications. I would recommend discussing this with Doctor Smith during your next appointment. She can assess your pain and determine the best course of action. Now, let's talk about your diet. You mentioned earlier that you're following a vegan and low-carb diet. Could you tell me a bit more about what you typically eat in a day? [INST] Patient: Oh, boy. Well, Yeah. I have some vegetables And [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Wiggins, could you please repeat what you typically eat in a day? [INST] Patient: Let's see. For breakfast, I eat a lot of fruit, Patient: and lunch, I try to eat vegetables, maybe some tofu, [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Wiggins. [INST] Patient: And for dinner, I'll try to have a big salad. [/INST] Nurse: It sounds like you're making an effort to include a variety of vegetables and fruits in your diet, Mr. Wiggins. That's great! Tofu is also a good source of protein. Just remember to keep an eye on your sodium intake, as some vegetarian products can be high in sodium. Would it be okay if I provide some suggestions about your diet? [INST] Patient: Yeah. To this, like, walking balance being for a tight rope. [/INST] Nurse: I understand, Mr. Wiggins. Balancing different dietary needs can indeed be challenging. One suggestion could be to incorporate more whole grains into your diet. They can provide you with energy and help control your blood sugar levels. Another suggestion could be to include more non-starchy vegetables, like broccoli or spinach, which are low in carbohydrates and high in fiber. Lastly, try to limit your intake of processed foods, as they can be high in sodium and unhealthy fats. Does that help? [INST] Patient: Yeah. That's great. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome, Mr. Wiggins. I'm glad I could provide some helpful suggestions. Now, let's move on to discussing your back surgeries. How has your recovery been going? [INST] Patient: Oh, well, it's know, it's going It's been several months since my last one, and I'm finally able to start doing some physical therapy, so that's good. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear, Mr. Wiggins. Physical therapy can be very beneficial for your recovery and overall health. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort during your physical therapy sessions? [INST] Patient: No. I just make sure I'm really careful. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Wiggins. It's essential to take it slow and steady with your physical therapy to avoid any setbacks. Now, let's move on to a different topic. Do you smoke cigarettes or vape? [INST] Patient: Do I have to answer that? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, Mr. Wiggins. This information is important for your health. It can help us understand your overall health status and potential risks. [INST] Patient: Yeah. I smoked a pack of cigarettes a day, but not ready to quit right now. [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Wiggins. Quitting smoking is a big step and it's important to do it when you feel ready. Can you share why you're not ready to quit at this time? [INST] Patient: Oh, I've tried to quit before, and it just gets me so stressed out. So \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\nPatient: Less stress and smoke. Drunk. So off the charts and cause more ticking damage. [/INST] Nurse: I can understand how quitting can be stressful, Mr. Wiggins. It's a big change and it's okay to take your time. When you feel ready, there are many resources available to help you quit. Would it be okay if I share some of these resources with you for future reference? [INST] Patient: You know, maybe emailed them to me, but right now, I don't wanna make a change. [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Wiggins. I'll make sure to email you some resources when we're done with our call. [INST] Patient: With the smoking. [/INST] Nurse: ",
