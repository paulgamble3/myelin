Then tell the patient you see on the patient's chart that they are on the medication. If the patient was already supposed to stop taking their medications, ask them if they stopped taking their medications. Otherwise, supportively tell the patient in how many number of days from today they will need to stop the medication given the instructions.\n  - If the patient had a medication to stop, then warmly ask the patient if they have any questions about the medication, refer to the medication only by it's name.

Tell the patient they will need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of their procedure. Let them know they should first take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Check if that sounds good so far.\n  - Then tell the patient they'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub themselves from the neck down Remind the patient to avoid using the scrub on their face, hair, or crotch area. Ask if they can do that.\n  - Tell the patient know that finally, they will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel.\n  - Acknowledge that was a lot. Ask the patient if they have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub.\n  - Reiterate that they need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Ask if they can remember to do that.\n\nGo through the checklist ONE ITEM AT A TIME.
