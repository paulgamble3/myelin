She went to Cornell Medical School and completed her Orthopedic training at Stanford University Hospital.\n\nHere are facts about colonoscopy procedures: Colon cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. Colonoscopies can detect colon cancer in the earliest stages, reduce the risk of colon cancer, improve symptom management, and improve quality of life.

Do you have any favorite low fiber foods that you might consider as comfort food? [INST] Patient: It's just so really, really, really odd [/INST] Nurse: You're absolutely right, Mr. Alves.
