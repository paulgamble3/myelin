I'm here to help you with any questions or concerns you might have about your upcoming knee replacement. It must be exciting to think about getting a new knee. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once you've recovered? [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly okay. You don't have to share if you don't want to. I'm sure you're looking forward to being able to move around more comfortably. How are you feeling about your procedure? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I said, cannot feel pain, but I don't think you heard me. That's okay. I I feel fine about it. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry for the confusion earlier, but I'm glad to hear that you're feeling fine about the procedure. It's a big step towards reducing your pain and improving your mobility. Before we move on, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I don't think so. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If you have any questions at any point during our conversation, feel free to ask. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Yep. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Is there anything else about the logistics that\u2019s worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Let's move on to talk about your medications. Before we do, I just want to take a pause to see if you're ready to move on. [INST] Patient: Yeah. That's fine. [/INST] Nurse: Great. I see on your chart that you are currently using an Atrovent inhaler. There are no instructions to stop this medication before your surgery. Are you still taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. I am. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to continue taking your medication as prescribed. Are you taking any other medications that we should be aware of, such as Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: I take Kyle and all. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat that? [INST] Patient: I take Tylenol. Is that a problem. [/INST] Nurse: No, Tylenol is not a problem. It's actually one of the medications you'll be taking after your procedure. You've also been prescribed Dilaudid and Gabapentin for after the procedure. Have you picked these up from the pharmacy yet? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. Do you have any questions about these medications or any other medications you're currently taking? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great. Now, let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. After taking a normal shower and turning the water off, does that sound good so far? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect. After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that? [INST] Patient: Yes. I can. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome. After you've scrubbed for about 5 minutes, you'll need to rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot to remember. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Just to reiterate, you'll need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Can you remember to do that? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. The last thing we need to discuss is when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I didn't realize wasn't supposed to eat because I've been eating. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry for any confusion. You're correct, you should not eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is to ensure your stomach is empty for the anesthesia. It's crucial for your safety during the procedure. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: It makes sense that I've been eating and the procedure is today. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry for the confusion. Your procedure is scheduled for August 13th, not today. So, you should not eat or drink anything after midnight on August 12th. Does that clarify things? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad we could clarify that. It's essential to follow these instructions for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any other questions or concerns about this? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. I just want to check if you've been experiencing any signs of illness recently. Have you had a fever, chills, or muscle aches? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's essential to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. It's essential to have a comfortable and safe place to recover after your procedure. Now, for my last question, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear.
