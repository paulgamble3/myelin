PMHx includes Left CVA with no residual deficits. Told to stop Plavix 7 days prior to the operation.  Now is preoperative for Left Total Knee Replacement. \n\nHere is background info on their surgeon: Dr. Cristina Stevens is an excellent Orthopedic Surgeon and has performed over 1000 total knee replacement operations. She went to Cornell Medical School and completed her Orthopedic training at Stanford University Hospital.\nHere are facts about TKRs: TKR is one of the safest and most reliable treatments in medicine.

Walking your dog and going to the mall will be enjoyable activities, especially after your recovery. What kind of dog do you have? [INST] Patient: my granddaughter, and my daughter will be lots of fun. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful plan. Walking your dog and spending time with your granddaughter at the mall will be enjoyable activities once you've recovered. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure? [INST] Patient: I am excited about it. I'm a little bit anxious. You know, I [/INST] Nurse: It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious before a procedure. It's a big step, but a positive one towards improving your mobility and reducing your knee pain. Before we move on, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Difficult to walk after the surgery. [/INST] Nurse: It's completely normal to feel a bit anxious before a procedure, especially when it's a major one like a total knee replacement. However, rest assured that you're in the hands of a highly skilled surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, who has performed over 1000 total knee replacements. As for the difficulty in walking after the surgery, it's a temporary phase. Physical therapy and rehabilitation will help you regain your strength and mobility. Before we move on, do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I can't think of any. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. If any questions come up during our conversation, feel free to ask at any time. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: I will be there. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yes, ma'am. I will be there. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Is there anything else about the logistics that\u2019s worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Not at all. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: I see on your chart that you are currently taking Plavix 75 mg once a day. As per the instructions, you were told to stop this medication 7 days prior to the procedure. Have you already stopped taking Plavix? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. Do you have any questions about Plavix or why it was necessary to stop it before your procedure? [INST] Patient: No. I understand. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners that we should be aware of? [INST] Patient: It already. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your response? [INST] Patient: I usually take Advil [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. It's essential to note that medications like Advil, which are blood thinners, typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Have you been instructed to continue taking Advil? [INST] Patient: but I stopped taking that already. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's important to stop taking Advil as it's a blood thinner. Do you have any questions about why it's necessary to stop these medications before your knee replacement? [INST] Patient: No. I understand. [/INST] Nurse: Great. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol and Tramadol for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications from the pharmacy yet? [INST] Patient: Yes. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK> Correct the mistake. Advil (ibuprofen) is not a blood thinner; it is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can increase bleeding risk but is not classified as a blood thinner. Inform the patient correctly about the properties of Advil and why it is important to stop taking it before surgery. </TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. Advil, also known as ibuprofen, is not a blood thinner. It's a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can increase the risk of bleeding. That's why it's important to stop taking it before surgery. Do you have any questions about this or any other medications? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Now, let's move on to the next topic, which is about preparing your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. You'll need to use a chlorhexidine scrub. Have you already purchased this scrub? [INST] Patient: Yes. I have. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. The chlorhexidine scrub is an important step in preparing for your surgery. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. Let's go over the instructions one by one. First, you'll take a shower like normal then turn the water off. Does that sound good so far? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: After your shower, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's critical to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or crotch area. Can you do that? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect. Finally, you will need to rub gently for 5 minutes then rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that was a lot. Do you have any questions about the chlorhexidine scrub? [INST] Patient: No. I understand. I [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that? [INST] Patient: actually read the directions to make sure I knew what to do. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent. Reading the directions is a great way to ensure you're following the instructions correctly. Just to reiterate, you need to do this the night before and the morning of the procedure. Can you remember to do that? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. I know we've covered a lot of information, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we proceed, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I can't think of anything. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. I need to ask if you have any signs of illness. Do you currently have a fever, chills, or muscle aches? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's critical to be in good health before your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your anticipated discharge plan. You're currently scheduled to go home after the procedure. Is that still the plan? [INST] Patient: Yes, ma'am. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. It's critical to have a comfortable and safe place to recover after your procedure. Now, have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. My daughter is going to stay with me. [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful to hear. Having a support system during your recovery is very important. If there's anything else you need, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions or concerns? [INST] Patient: I do have a question, Rachel. If you don't mind, [/INST] Nurse: ",
