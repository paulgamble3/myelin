    "responses": {
        "G2": "I appreciate your question, Mr. Wiggins. There are five stages of kidney disease, with stage 1 being the mildest and stage 5 being the most severe. Stage 2, which you're in, means that your kidneys are not working at their full potential, but they're still functioning reasonably well. It's important to manage your health to prevent progression to later stages. Would you like me to go over a few topics with you to check on how you're doing?",
        "G5": "I'm glad to hear that you're taking your medications as prescribed, Mr. Wiggins. It's important to maintain consistency with your Metformin and Tylenol. Now, I'd like to ask about your diet. I understand that you're following a vegan diet. Can you tell me a bit more about what you've been eating recently?",
        "G7": "I'm glad you asked. There are five stages of kidney disease. Stage 2 means that your kidneys are not working at their full potential, but they are still able to do their job. It's important to manage your other health conditions, like your diabetes and blood pressure, to help slow the progression of kidney disease.  Is there anything else you would like to know?",
        "gpt4": "I can definitely see how having kidney disease can be worrisome, Mr. Wiggins. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has five stages in total, going from stage 1 to stage 5. Stage 2, where you are, means that your kidneys are not working at full strength, but the decrease in kidney function is somewhat mild. Would it be alright if I explain how we measure kidney function?"
