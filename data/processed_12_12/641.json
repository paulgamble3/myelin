[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Ana Aguirre? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming. Could you please provide your date of birth for verification purposes? [INST] Patient: March fourteenth nineteen fifty. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming, Ms. Aguirre. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Lynne Contreras, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately? [INST] Patient: Fine. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Aguirre. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? [INST] Patient: Not necessarily. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Aguirre. Sometimes it's nice to have a quiet week. Before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, I wanted to ask if there are any symptoms or health concerns you've been experiencing lately that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Hello? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, Ms. Aguirre, I'm here. You mentioned earlier that you're doing fine. I was asking if there are any symptoms or health concerns you've been experiencing lately that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Ms. Aguirre. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, please feel free to bring them up. Are you okay if we go over a few topics to check on how you're doing with your chronic conditions? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent, thank you, Ms. Aguirre. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was? [INST] Patient: Wood twenty eight. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Aguirre, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your last blood sugar reading? [INST] Patient: One twenty eight. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Aguirre. A blood sugar level of 128 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes. Would it be okay if I provide some recommendations to help manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: No. That's okay. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>You didn't quite hear what the patient said. You think the patient said that their blood sugar is high or low. Ask the patient to confirm.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry for any confusion, Ms. Aguirre. You mentioned that your blood sugar level was 128. Is that correct? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate you letting me know. Give me a moment to check how I can best help you. I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you. Thank you for confirming, Ms. Aguirre. I understand that you don't want any recommendations at this time. Let's move on to your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure measurement? [INST] Patient: Today. [/INST] Nurse: That's great, Ms. Aguirre. Could you please tell me what the result was? [INST] Patient: One twenty over eighty five. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Aguirre. A blood pressure reading of 120 over 85 is within the acceptable range. It's essential to keep monitoring it regularly. Do you have any questions about your blood pressure or the readings you've been getting? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Ms. Aguirre. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results? [INST] Patient: Yeah. What does the potassium and sodium mean? [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question, Ms. Aguirre. Sodium and potassium are both types of electrolytes, which are minerals in your body that have an electric charge. They are necessary for your body to function properly, including your heart, muscles, and nerves. Sodium helps control your body's fluid balance and also helps your nerves and muscles work properly. Potassium helps your nerves and muscles, including your heart, to function properly. The normal range for sodium is typically between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). The normal range for potassium is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 mEq/L. Your recent lab results showed a sodium level of 137 mEq/L and a potassium level of 4.5 mEq/L, which are both within the normal ranges. Does that help clarify things for you, Ms. Aguirre? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Aguirre. If you have any other questions about your lab results or anything else, feel free to ask. Now, I'd like to discuss your medications. You're currently taking Metformin 500 mg once a day. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes.

[/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Aguirre. It's essential to take Tylenol only when you need it for pain. Lastly, you're prescribed Atorvastatin 40 mg, which you should be taking once daily. Have you been taking this medication as prescribed? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful, Ms. Aguirre. It's critical to take your Atorvastatin as prescribed to manage your cholesterol levels. I want to acknowledge that it's common to miss a dose here or there. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time? [INST] Patient: Hello? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, Ms. Aguirre, I'm here. I was asking if you ever have trouble remembering to take your medications on time? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's fantastic, Ms. Aguirre.

[/INST] Nurse: It's great to hear that you're following a low carb and low salt diet, Ms. Aguirre. As a Stage IV CKD patient, it's important to follow a diet that's low in sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. This means avoiding foods like bananas, oranges, potatoes, and dairy products. Instead, you should focus on foods like apples, berries, peppers, and lean meats. Would it be okay if I provide some more detailed recommendations? [INST] Patient: No. That's okay. [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your response, Ms. Aguirre. You're doing a great job following a low carb and low salt diet. Remember, it's always important to consult with your doctor or a dietitian before making any major changes to your diet. Now, let's move on to discuss your back surgeries. How has your recovery been going? [INST] Patient: Fine. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Aguirre. It's important to continue with any physical therapy or exercises recommended by your doctor to aid in your recovery. Now, I'd like to ask about your smoking habits. Do you currently smoke cigarettes or use any vaping devices? [INST] Patient: Yes. I do. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Aguirre. I know it's not easy to talk about. Have you ever considered quitting smoking? [INST] Patient: No. I don't really want to. [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Aguirre. It's a big decision to make. Could you share with me why you feel you're not ready to quit smoking at this time? [INST] Patient: Just too much of a commitment right now. [/INST] Nurse: I understand, Ms. Aguirre. It's a significant change and it's okay to feel that it's too much right now. If you ever decide to consider quitting, I have a lot of resources that I could share with you.
