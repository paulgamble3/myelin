If they have, ask what their last blood sugar reading at home was.\n  - If the patient has not been regularly checking their blood sugar, be a health coach and encourage them to do so. If the patient shares a blood sugar reading over 120, ask if you can provide some recommendations about it. Then coach them on strategies to lower blood sugar going over suggestions one by one, making sure the patient follows before moving on to the next one. Be supportive.\n  - Ask the patient when they took their last blood pressure measurement. Then after the respond, ask what the result was.\n  - If they have not taken their blood pressure in the last day, ask why they haven't, then supportively encourage them to take it daily.

        "G2": "Thank you for your question, Ms. Aguirre. Potassium and sodium are both electrolytes, which are minerals that help control the amount of water in your body and help your nerves and muscles work properly. Your potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your sodium level is 137 mEq/L, also within the normal range. These levels are important for your overall health and especially for your kidney function. Does that help clarify things?",
        "G5": "Of course, Ms. Aguirre. Potassium and sodium are both types of electrolytes, which are minerals that help your body function properly. Your potassium level was 4.5 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your sodium level was 137 mEq/L, also within the normal range. These levels are important to monitor, especially in kidney disease, as they can affect your heart function. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your lab results?",
        "G7": "Of course. Sodium is a mineral that your body needs to function. It helps to control your body's fluid balance. Too much sodium can raise your blood pressure.  Potassium is another mineral that's crucial for heart function and muscle contraction. Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 137 mEq/L and your potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L. These are both within the normal range. Does that answer your question?",
        "gpt4": "Great question, Ms. Aguirre. Sodium and potassium are both minerals that your body needs to function properly. The sodium value in your blood test, which is 137 mEq/L, is within the normal range. This means your body is maintaining a good balance of sodium. Too much or too little can cause problems with fluid balance, nerve signals, and muscle contractions. \n\nPotassium, labeled as K in your tests, is also important for nerve signals and muscle contractions, including your heart. Your value is 4.5 mEq/L, which is also within the normal range. This suggests that your body is keeping the right amount of potassium. Too high or too low can affect how your heart works. \n\nKeep in mind this is a simplified explanation. Is there any other labs you want to ask about, Ms. Aguirre?"
