[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Trisha Raynier? [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: Can you confirm if you're Trisha Raynier? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Ms. Raynier, I'm calling to check in with you about your upcoming total knee replacement surgery on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need and answer any questions you may have. How are you doing today? [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: Ms. Raynier, how's your day going so far? [INST] Patient: I'm doing alright. Thanks. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. [INST] Patient: Just said, \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. It sounds like you're doing well. I'm glad to hear that. [INST] Patient: Okay. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. It sounds like you're having a good day so far. I'm glad to hear that. Can you tell me a little bit about how you're feeling about your upcoming procedure? [INST] Patient: I'm a little bit nervous to be honest. Is it going to be painful after the surgery? [/INST] Nurse: I completely understand your concern. It's normal to feel a little apprehensive before any surgery. Let me reassure you that we have an excellent team of medical professionals who will do their best to minimize any discomfort during and after the procedure. We will make sure you have adequate pain management and our team will closely monitor your progress throughout the entire process. Now, let's move on to the logistics of your procedure. Can I review a few details with you to ensure everything is in order? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. First, I want to remind you that you're scheduled for a left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Does that sound okay with you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Now, let's talk about your medications. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Plavix, Gabapentin, Advil, and Cymbalta. Can you tell me if you've stopped taking Plavix 7 days prior to your procedure as instructed? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. I also see that you've been prescribed Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day as needed and Tramadol 100 mg once a day for after the procedure. Have you picked up those medications yet? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Now, I want to talk to you about preparing your skin for surgery. We recommend that you use a chlorhexidine scrub to reduce the risk of infection. Have you purchased the scrub yet? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Now, let me go over the instructions with you. You'll need to use the scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. First, take a shower like normal, then turn the water off. Next, apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth and gently scrub yourself from the neck down, avoiding your face, hair, and crotch area. Finally, rub gently for 5 minutes, rinse the solution off, and pat dry with a clean towel. Does that sound doable? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Now, I want to talk to you about when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about that? [INST] Patient: What happened till I get thirsty? [/INST] Nurse: It's critical to stay hydrated, but you'll need to avoid drinking anything after midnight before your procedure. However, if you get thirsty, you can suck on ice chips or have a sip of water. Just make sure to avoid drinking anything substantial. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: Ms. Raynier, do you have any questions about when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Now, let's verify a few logistical details. First, can you tell me if you have any signs of illness, such as a fever, chills, or muscle aches? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Second, can you confirm that your anticipated discharge plan is to go home after the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great. Finally, have you arranged for a ride home and someone to stay with you after the procedure? [INST] Patient: But I'm anxious about needing more help. Do you think I'll need more people? [/INST] Nurse: I completely understand your concern. It's always a good idea to have someone with you after the procedure, especially for the first night. It's important to have someone who can help you with basic tasks like getting up and down the stairs or getting you a glass of water. If you don't have someone lined up yet, don't worry. You still have time to arrange for someone to be on standby to come pick you up when the hospital calls and stay with you afterward. Does that make you feel better? [INST] Patient: That's not what I said. I have one person who's staying with me. But do I need more than one person? [/INST] Nurse: I apologize for misunderstanding your question. It's not necessary to have more than one person, but it's always good to have a backup plan in case your primary caregiver is unavailable. If you're comfortable with just one person, that's perfectly fine. Now, that was all the topics for today. But do you have any questions or concerns? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Is it gonna be difficult for me to walk after surgery? [/INST] Nurse: It's normal to feel a little unsteady when you first start walking after surgery. But don't worry, we'll have physical therapists who will work with you to help you regain your strength and mobility. They'll teach you how to walk safely with your new knee and help you with exercises to strengthen your muscles. Does that make you feel better? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: ",
