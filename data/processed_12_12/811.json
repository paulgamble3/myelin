        "G2": "That's a great question, Ellen. Everyone's recovery process is unique, but generally, you can expect to start feeling some relief from your knee pain within a few weeks after surgery. However, it's important to remember that full recovery can take several months. During this time, physical therapy will play a crucial role in helping you regain strength and mobility in your knee. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the surgery?",
        "G5": "That's a great question. Everyone's recovery is different, but generally, you should start feeling better within a few weeks. The pain will gradually decrease as you heal, and physical therapy will help you regain strength and mobility. It's important to remember that it's a process and it won't happen overnight. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the surgery?",
        "G7": "Everyone's recovery timeline is different, but most patients start to see improvement in their pain levels within the first few weeks after surgery. It's important to remember that full recovery can take several months. However, the goal is for you to eventually return to your normal activities without pain. Does that answer your question?",
        "gpt4": "That's a good question. It varies for different patients, but generally, you may start to see an improvement in pain levels after a few weeks. However, the full benefits of a total knee replacement can take a few months to materialize as your body heals and you regain strength and mobility through physical therapy. Does this timeline sound okay to you? Would you like to learn more about any other aspects of your recovery process?"
