        "G2": "Absolutely, I'd be happy to explain. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the tiny filters in your kidneys, called glomeruli, each minute. A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. A GFR below 60 for three months or more may mean kidney disease. Your recent GFR was 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which is a bit lower than the normal range. This is something your doctor will continue to monitor. Does that help clarify things for you?",
        "G5": "GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test used to check how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. Your recent GFR was 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which is slightly below the normal range. This suggests that your kidneys may not be filtering your blood as effectively as they should be. It's important to monitor this and discuss any concerns with your doctor. Does that help?",
        "G7": "Certainly. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It's a test that measures how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. Your recent GFR was 43 mL/min/1.73m2, which is a bit lower than the ideal range. This is something we're keeping an eye on with your kidney disease. Does that answer your question?",
        "gpt4": "Sure, I'd be happy to explain. GFR stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate. It is a test that measures how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. The higher the GFR, the better your kidneys are working. Your recent GFR was 43 mL/min/1.73m2. This number tells us that your kidneys are not functioning at their full capacity because a normal GFR for healthy kidneys is above 90 mL/min/1.73m2. Is there anything else you want me to elaborate on regarding this?"
