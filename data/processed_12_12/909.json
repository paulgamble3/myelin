    "responses": {
        "G2": "I'm sorry, Mr. Wiggins, could you please repeat your question?",
        "G5": "I'm glad to hear you're following a vegan diet, Mr. Wiggins. It's a great choice for managing your health conditions. As for your question, a diet with around 130 grams of carbohydrates and less than 230 mg of sodium per day is recommended for your conditions. Would it be alright if I provide some suggestions based on this?",
        "G7": "It's great to hear that you're following a vegan diet. As for your sodium intake, it's recommended to limit your sodium to less than 2300 mg per day.  As for carbohydrates, a dietitian would recommend about 130 grams per day.  Would you like me to go over some foods that fit into those categories?",
        "gpt4": "Certainly, Mr. Wiggins. It's truly commendable that you're following a vegan, low carb, and low salt diet. This is generally beneficial for a patient with Stage II CKD. To optimize your diet, aim for a balanced and varied intake of food. Foods high in fiber such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes are beneficial in controlling blood sugar and cholesterol levels. However, it's also important to not exceed a daily carbohydrate limit of around 130 grams. Maintaining sodium intake below 2300 mg per day can also help control your blood pressure, a critical factor in managing CKD. Beyond this, keep track of your potassium and protein intake, which should be discussed with your nutritionist or doctor. Are there any specifics you would like assistance with?"
