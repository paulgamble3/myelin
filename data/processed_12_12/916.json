        "G2": "Colorectal cancer, also known as colon cancer, is a type of cancer that begins in the large intestine (colon) or the rectum (end of the colon). It usually starts as small, noncancerous (benign) clumps of cells called polyps that form on the inside of the colon. Over time, some of these polyps can become colon cancers. Regular screenings like colonoscopies can help detect these polyps early, when they're easier to remove and before they turn into cancer. Does that help clarify things?",
        "G5": "Colorectal cancer, also known as colon cancer, is a type of cancer that starts in the large intestine or rectum. It usually begins as small growths, or polyps, in the colon or rectum. These polyps can become cancerous over time if not detected and removed. A colonoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to examine the inside of your colon and rectum to check for these polyps and other abnormalities. It's a preventative measure to help detect and treat potential issues early.",
        "G7": "Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the colon or rectum. The colon and the rectum are parts of the large intestine. Colorectal cancer occurs when some of the cells that line the colon or the rectum become abnormal and grow out of control.  These cells can then invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. \n\nA colonoscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to look at the inner lining of your large intestine (rectum and colon). They will look at the entire colon.  This is done using a thin, flexible tube called a colonoscope. \n\nThe colonoscope is put in through your rectum and into your intestine. If your doctor finds polyps (small growths that could turn into cancer), they can be removed during the colonoscopy. \n\nThe goal of a colonoscopy is to find and remove polyps before they turn into cancer.  Do you have any other questions?",

The good news is a colonoscopy can detect colon cancer in its earliest stages, and when found early, it can often be treated more effectively. Would you like more information on this?"
