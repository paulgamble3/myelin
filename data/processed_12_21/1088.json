This Discharge Planning Policy is approved by the hospital leadership and is reviewed periodically to ensure its continued relevance, effectiveness, and compliance with regulatory standards.\nWhat goes into discharge planning?\nDischarge planning involves several steps.

The attending physician, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary care team, assesses the patient's medical condition, social support, and functional abilities to determine appropriate post-discharge care arrangements. The patient's preferences, cultural beliefs, and available community resources are taken into account. \n\nDischarge instructions are provided to patients or their designated decision-makers in a culturally and linguistically appropriate manner, including comprehensive information regarding the patient's medical condition, prescribed medications, diet restrictions, activity limitations, wound care instructions, and any necessary medical equipment needed post-discharge.\n\nPost-discharge care coordination involves collaboration with patients, their families, and relevant healthcare providers to facilitate seamless transitions of care. The team assesses and coordinates any necessary post-discharge services, including home healthcare, rehabilitation, medical equipment, physical therapy, or other support services. \n\nFollow-up appointments are determined by the attending physician, in consultation with the interdisciplinary care team. The scheduling of these appointments is communicated to patients during the discharge process. \n\nMedication reconciliation is conducted at admission, during the hospital stay, and at the time of discharge. The interdisciplinary care team collaborates to ensure accurate and up-to-date medication lists for all patients. The discharge planning team reconciles medications in collaboration with the attending physician, pharmacist, and other relevant healthcare professionals. \n\nFinally, compliance with the discharge planning process is monitored through regular audits and review of discharge planning documentation. All healthcare professionals involved in the discharge planning process receive adequate education and training on the principles and procedures outlined in the policy.\nWill my medications be reviewed before discharge?\nThe policy mandates medication reconciliation to ensure patient safety and optimal treatment outcomes. Medication reconciliation shall be conducted at admission, during the hospital stay, and at the time of discharge. The interdisciplinary care team shall collaborate to ensure accurate and up-to-date medication lists for all patients. The discharge planning team shall reconcile medications in collaboration with the attending physician, pharmacist, and other relevant healthcare professionals. Patients or their designated decision-makers shall receive a finalized medication list, including any changes made during the hospital stay and detailed instructions for proper medication administration post-discharge.

This policy is designed to ensure a smooth transition from the hospital to your home or another care setting. It includes comprehensive discharge instructions, coordination of post-discharge care, and scheduling of follow-up appointments. The process begins as soon as you're admitted to the hospital. Your doctor and a team of healthcare professionals will assess your medical condition, social support, and functional abilities to determine the best post-discharge care for you. They'll also take into account your preferences and cultural beliefs. Before you're discharged, your medications will be reviewed and reconciled to ensure safety and optimal treatment outcomes. This means that the team will make sure your medication list is accurate and up-to-date, and they'll provide you with detailed instructions for taking your medications after you leave the hospital. The team will also coordinate any necessary post-discharge services, such as home healthcare, rehabilitation, or physical therapy.
