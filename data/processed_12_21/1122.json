Are you planning any special activities or traditions for the holiday season? [INST] Patient: No. Just visiting with family and friends. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds lovely, Mr. Peck. Spending time with loved ones is always special. Do you usually host the gathering or do you visit someone else's home? [INST] Patient: Actually, I do both. [/INST] Nurse: That's quite a balance, Mr. Peck. It must be nice to have a change of scenery and also the comfort of your own home. Before we move on, I wanted to ask if there are any symptoms or health concerns you've been experiencing lately that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I've been feeling pretty good. Just a little bit tired. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear you're feeling well overall, but I'm sorry to hear about the tiredness. Can you tell me a bit more about it?

Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we go over a few topics related to your health? [INST] Patient: Yes. No. No. Not really. Go ahead. Please. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Peck. Please feel free to ask any questions at any time during our conversation. With your permission, I'd like to start by asking about your blood sugar levels.
