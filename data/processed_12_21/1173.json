The discharge planning process begins promptly upon admission to identify patients' needs for post-discharge care and support. The attending physician, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary care team, assesses the patient's medical condition, social support, and functional abilities to determine appropriate post-discharge care arrangements. The discharge planning team collaborates with patients, their families, and relevant healthcare providers to facilitate seamless transitions of care.

These include the patient's need for privacy or rest, the need for privacy or rest by another individual in the patient\u2019s shared room, a health, safety, or infection risk to the patient, visitor, or others, and in case of a pandemic or infectious disease outbreak. Visitation may also be restricted if there are too many visitors at one time for a patient, if visitors have cough, cold or respiratory symptoms, or if there are any substance abuse treatment protocols or other treatment protocols requiring restricted visitation. Additionally, visiting may be limited if there are applicable court orders limiting or restraining contact with the patient or others. Staff may also impose reasonable limitations on the number of visitors at any one time consistent with the guidelines of this policy, space limitations, safety, security, and needs of the patient.<</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: Certainly, Mr. Gates.

These include receiving considerate and respectful care, knowing the names and roles of your healthcare providers, getting information about your illness and treatment in understandable terms, and participating actively in decisions regarding your medical care. You also have the right to privacy and confidentiality, to reasonable responses to your requests, and to leave the hospital even against the advice of physicians, among others. Regarding your question about discharge planning, there is indeed a policy in place. This policy ensures that the process for your discharge includes comprehensive instructions, post-discharge care coordination, and follow-up appointments. The goal is to support continuity of care and patient safety. [INST] Patient: How do I request the medical records for my most recent stay. [/INST] Nurse: To request your medical records, you'll typically need to contact the hospital's health information management (HIM) or medical records department.
