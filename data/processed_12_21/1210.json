[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital on a recorded line. Is this Shizu Nakamura? [INST] Patient: Yes. It is. [/INST] Nurse: Thanks for taking my call. Just so you know, I\u2019m an AI Chronic Care Manager. Hundreds of real doctors and nurses helped prepare me to speak with patients like you. I've also been trained on hundreds of medical textbooks and your care team provided me with notes to prepare for this call. -- Before we begin, can you share your date of birth so I can protect your privacy by verifying your identity? [INST] Patient: Shows January first nineteen sixty. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming your date of birth, Mr. Nakamura. I'm calling about your upcoming colonoscopy on August 13th at 9:00 AM. Is this a good time to talk about it? Also, how has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: I guess it is. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Nakamura. [INST] Patient: It's been okay. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Nakamura. I hope your day continues to go well. As we discuss your upcoming colonoscopy, please feel free to ask any questions or share any concerns you might have. How are you feeling about the procedure? [INST] Patient: I guess, okay. Do do people get credit. It's getting a colonoscopy, Rachel. [/INST] Nurse: I can see why you might ask that, Mr. Nakamura. Colonoscopies are a key tool in preventing colon cancer, which is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. By detecting any abnormalities or changes in the colon early, colonoscopies can significantly reduce the risk of colon cancer. They can also help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. So, in a way, you could say that getting a colonoscopy is a proactive step towards maintaining your health. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the procedure? [INST] Patient: Well, if I do, so [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Nakamura, could you please repeat what you just said? [INST] Patient: This is my second time that I got it, and I had a very bad reaction. To it. Do you think the second time around will be better for me? [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that your previous experience was not pleasant, Mr. Nakamura. It's not uncommon for patients to have different experiences with each procedure. Factors such as the preparation process, the sedation used, and even your overall health at the time can influence how you react. Your gastroenterologist, Doctor Meredith Bailey, is highly experienced and will do her best to ensure your comfort. If you're comfortable sharing, could you tell me more about the reaction you had last time? This information could be helpful for your care team. [INST] Patient: Oh, yes. I had a lot of reading after my colonoscopy. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you experienced bleeding after your previous colonoscopy, Mr. Nakamura. This can sometimes occur, especially if a polyp was removed during the procedure. However, it's not a common occurrence and it's something your care team will want to be aware of. I'll make a note of this for them to review. In the meantime, it might be helpful to know that Doctor Bailey has performed over 1500 colonoscopies and is highly skilled. She'll be taking every precaution to ensure your procedure goes smoothly. Is there anything else about your previous experience that you're concerned about? [INST] Patient: Yes. Last time it was just it was really hard for me because English is my second language, and I feel more comfortable speaking in my own language. It seems like the nurses, and and the doctor can understand what I was asking. [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate you letting me know. Give me a moment to check how I can best help you. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that communication was a challenge during your last procedure, Mr. Nakamura.
