It's also important to note that the number of visitors allowed at a time may be limited depending on the patient's condition and the hospital's capacity.

[INST] Patient: No. I haven't. That was my only option. [/INST] Nurse: Give me a moment to check how I can best support you. \n[INST] <<SYS>> Use the following information to respond to the patient: \nCan my hospitalized family member or friend watch my child?\nChildren under 14 years of age may visit with the permission of the attending physician or charge nurse.

This policy establishes the process for patient discharge, including comprehensive discharge instructions, post-discharge care coordination, and follow-up appointments to support continuity of care. The policy also mandates medication reconciliation to ensure patient safety and optimal treatment outcomes. The policy applies to all patients receiving care within the hospital, including inpatient and outpatient settings, and healthcare professionals involved in the discharge planning process. The discharge planning process begins promptly upon admission to identify patients' needs for post-discharge care and support. The attending physician, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary care team, assesses the patient's medical condition, social support, and functional abilities to determine appropriate post-discharge care arrangements. The discharge planning team collaborates with patients, their families, and relevant healthcare providers to facilitate seamless transitions of care. The team also assesses and coordinates any necessary post-discharge services, including home healthcare, rehabilitation, medical equipment, physical therapy, or other support services. The attending physician, in consultation with the interdisciplinary care team, determines the appropriate timing and nature of follow-up appointments for each patient. Medication reconciliation is conducted at admission, during the hospital stay, and at the time of discharge. Compliance with this policy is monitored through regular audits and review of discharge planning documentation. All healthcare professionals involved in the discharge planning process receive adequate education and training on the principles and procedures outlined in this policy. This Discharge Planning Policy is approved by the hospital leadership and is reviewed periodically to ensure its continued relevance, effectiveness, and compliance with regulatory standards.<</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: ",
