[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital on a recorded line. Is this Josef Moran? [INST] Patient: I mean, [/INST] Nurse: Hello, this is Rachel, your chronic care management AI Nurse. May I confirm if I'm speaking with the patient I'm supposed to be calling? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your response. For the purpose of confidentiality, could you please confirm if you are Mr. Moran? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thanks for taking my call. Just so you know, I\u2019m an AI Chronic Care Manager. Hundreds of real doctors and nurses helped prepare me to speak with patients like you. I've also been trained on hundreds of medical textbooks and your care team provided me with notes to prepare for this call. -- Before we begin, can you share your date of birth so I can protect your privacy by verifying your identity? [INST] Patient: It's January seventeenth nineteen eighty five. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming your date of birth. I'm calling from O'Connor Hospital about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: If it is, [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for your time. I hope your day is going well so far. Can you share a bit about how you've been feeling today? [INST] Patient: I'm just a little nervous, but if you wanna get ready and Patient: prepare for my procedure. [/INST] Nurse: I can imagine that feeling nervous is completely normal, especially when you're about to have a procedure. It's a big step, but remember, you're in the hands of an excellent team at O'Connor Hospital. Is there anything specific that's making you feel nervous? [INST] Patient: You know, it's you know, I have to work. It's your Wi Fi a cell bill in the hospital. Patient: Like, that's does the hospital provide Internet access to patients? [/INST] Nurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. [/INST] Nurse: I can see why having internet access would be important to you, especially if you need to work. The good news is that O'Connor Hospital provides free wireless internet access throughout the hospital, including patient rooms, the main lobby, and our cafeteria. The network is broadcast as HHS_Guest, and your wireless device should recognize this and allow you to connect. However, please note that the hospital cannot provide or loan laptops or computers to patients, and technical support for personal devices is not available. Also, remember that wireless networks are shared among all users and are public, so use caution when sending personal, identifiable, or sensitive information. Does this help alleviate some of your concerns? [INST] Patient: Also, that so my question my next question is, has the hospital the Wi Fi has it ever been hacked because I I do need to work, and some of the things are are sensitive. [/INST] Nurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. [/INST] Nurse: I can see why you'd be concerned about the security of your sensitive work information. While O'Connor Hospital provides free wireless internet access, it's important to remember that all wireless networks are shared among users and are public. The hospital takes measures to secure its network, but like any public Wi-Fi, it's not immune to potential risks. Therefore, it's recommended to use caution when sending personal, identifiable, or sensitive information. If your work involves handling sensitive data, you might want to consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) or similar security measures. Does this information help? [INST] Patient: Yeah. How do I how do I get a VPN [/INST] Nurse: Setting up a VPN can be a great way to secure your internet connection, especially when using public Wi-Fi. Here are some general steps to get you started: Choose a VPN service: There are many VPN services available, both free and paid. Some popular ones include NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and CyberGhost. It's important to research and choose one that best fits your needs in terms of security, speed, and cost. Download and install: Once you've chosen a VPN service, you'll need to download and install their software. This is usually a straightforward process, and most VPN services provide detailed instructions on their websites. Connect to the VPN: After installation, you'll need to open the VPN software and connect to a server. This could be a server in your own country or in a different country, depending on your needs. Secure browsing: Once connected, your internet browsing should be secure. All your internet traffic will be encrypted and routed through the VPN server, making it much harder for anyone to access your data. Remember, while a VPN can provide an extra layer of security, it's still important to follow good internet safety practices, such as keeping your devices and software up to date, and being cautious of phishing attempts. Does this help you understand how to set up a VPN? [INST] Patient: No. This this was very helpful. After my procedure, do you think that I'd be able to work on my laptop, While I'm staying at the hospital, [/INST] Nurse: Just give me a second to work out the best way I can assist you. [/INST] Nurse: I can see why you'd want to know about working during your hospital stay. After your total knee replacement, you'll likely be able to use your laptop while you're recovering in the hospital. However, it's important to listen to your body and rest when needed. The main goal is for you to recover, and while it's understandable that you may need to work, it's also important to give your body the rest it needs to heal. As for the hospital's visitor policy, O\u2019Connor Hospital restricts access to its campuses to individuals obtaining or seeking health care, accompanying or visiting patients or staff, or conducting lawful business. Every patient has the right to receive the visitors they designate, including a spouse, domestic partner, another family member, or a friend, and the right to deny such consent at any time. Visitation may be limited by the care team or hospital administration for failure to comply with the guidelines, in response to public health and other crises, and for any other reason that may present a safety or security risk to patients or others. If you're in a shared room, visiting may be restricted due to the need for privacy or rest by another individual in your room.
