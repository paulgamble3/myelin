        "G15": "I apologize for any confusion, Carla. You're currently prescribed Cellcept, not insulin. As for your question, the dosage of certain medications, including Cellcept, can be affected by kidney disease. It's important to follow your doctor's instructions and take your medication as prescribed. Have you picked up your new medications, Lasix and Lisinopril, from the pharmacy?",
        "G15DPO": "I apologize for any confusion. You're currently prescribed Cellcept, not insulin. The dosage of your medication is managed by your doctor based on your overall health and how your body responds to the medication. Does that help clarify things?",
        "gpt4": "I apologize for any confusion, but according to your medical records, you're currently prescribed Cellcept, not insulin. Cellcept is an immunosuppressant medication often used in patients with Lupus to help manage the disease. \n\nAs for your kidney disease, it's in the early stages (Stage I), and your kidney function is still quite good. Therefore, it's unlikely that your kidney disease would significantly affect the dosage of your Cellcept at this time. However, it's important to continue monitoring your kidney function through regular lab tests, as changes in your kidney function could potentially require adjustments to your medication dosages in the future. \n\nDoes that help clarify things for you?"
