The attending physician, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary care team, assesses the patient's medical condition, social support, and functional abilities to determine appropriate post-discharge care arrangements. The discharge planning team collaborates with patients, their families, and relevant healthcare providers to facilitate seamless transitions of care. The team also assesses and coordinates any necessary post-discharge services, including home healthcare, rehabilitation, medical equipment, physical therapy, or other support services. The attending physician, in consultation with the interdisciplinary care team, determines the appropriate timing and nature of follow-up appointments for each patient.
