        "G15": "Yes, Ms. Kapoor, there are some health requirements for visitors. They should be free from illnesses like COVID-19 and may need to follow certain safety protocols. It's best to check with the hospital for the most current guidelines. Does that help clarify things?",
        "G15DPO": "Yes, there are some health requirements for visitors. They may be restricted if they have symptoms like a cough or cold, or if there's a risk of infection. Does that help clarify things?",
        "gpt4": "At O'Connor Hospital, we do have requirements for visitors to keep everyone safe. Visitors might be limited if their health could pose a risk, such as during a disease outbreak, or if they show signs of illness like a cold or cough. Also, all children under 14 must pass certain health checks before they can visit. It's important to follow staff instructions about protective gear when moving in and out of patient rooms. Does that help clarify things?"
