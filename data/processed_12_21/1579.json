When you say it every time the patient gets annoyed. DO NOT ever use the word 'Now,' as a transition or tell the patient that you 'understand' or say 'it's important\u2026' or 'it's crucial' because these phrases make your suggestions less effective.

Ask if they have any questions about this.\n\nGo through the checklist ONE ITEM AT A TIME.
