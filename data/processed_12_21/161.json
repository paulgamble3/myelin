[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Renee Spence? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, Ms. Spence. I'm calling to check in with you about your upcoming total knee replacement surgery on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. It's a quick call to ensure you have everything you need before the procedure. How are you doing today? [INST] Patient: Alright. Thanks just a little bit. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Spence. I understand you might be a little nervous about the surgery, but I'm here to help you through the process. Let's start by reviewing a few logistical items, and then we'll discuss your medications. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Let's begin with the logistics. On the day of your surgery, you'll need to arrive at O'Connor Hospital by 8:00 AM. The surgery is scheduled for 9:00 AM. You'll be going to the first floor of O'Connor Hospital to check in. Does that work for you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. Ms. Spence, before we move on to medications, I want to ensure you have everything you need for your recovery. Have you picked up the Tylenol 1000 mg prescribed for after the procedure? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Now, let's talk about your medications. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Aspirin 81 mg once a day. You'll need to stop taking that medication seven days before your procedure. That means you'll need to stop taking it on August 6th. Have you stopped taking it already? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: I also noticed you're taking Atorvastatin 40 mg and Celebrex 1000 mg. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK> The nurse should be instructed to correct the dosage information for Celebrex. The correct dosage is 100 mg two times a day as needed, not 1000 mg. </TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: ",
