[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Aileen Ware? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Hello. I'm glad to hear you're back home from the hospital. How are you feeling today? [INST] Patient: I'm okay. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. It must be a relief to be back in your own home. Is there anything in particular you've been looking forward to doing now that you're home? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: That's alright. Sometimes it's just nice to be in familiar surroundings. By the way, do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: That's okay. We all have our own ways of spending our time. How about the weather? [INST] Patient: It's been raining. [/INST] Nurse: Oh, I see. Rain can be quite relaxing though, don't you think? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad you see it that way. I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Sarah Forbes today, and I have a few topics to cover with you. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address? [INST] Patient: No. I don't. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, let's move on to your medications then. Are you still taking your Lasix and Lisinopril as prescribed by Doctor Forbes? [INST] Patient: Yes. I am.
