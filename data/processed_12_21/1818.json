[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from Sheba Medical Center on a recorded line. Is this David Rosen? [INST] Patient: It says, [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please confirm if this is David Rosen? [INST] Patient: This is. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming. I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Robert Friedman to follow up on your chronic care management. [INST] Patient: Okay. [/INST] Nurse: Great, I'm calling on behalf of Dr. Robert Friedman, your Surgeon. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth? [INST] Patient: January one nineteen eighty. [/INST] Nurse: Thanks for confirming that. I'm your AI Post-Discharge Specialist. Dr. Friedman asked me to check in on you after your discharge from the hospital. How are you doing today? [INST] Patient: Doing pretty good. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Being back home must feel good after your stay at the hospital. Is there anything specific you're looking forward to doing? [INST] Patient: Oh, I just can't wait to get outside and they're taking lots of my [/INST] Nurse: That sounds lovely. Being outdoors can be so refreshing. Do you have a favorite spot you like to visit? [INST] Patient: No. I just walked the neighborhood. [/INST] Nurse: Walking around the neighborhood can be quite enjoyable. I'm sure it's nice to see familiar sights. I'm here to check on how you're doing with your new medications. Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we go over them? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I do have some questions about it. Yeah. That one medication that starts with a g. It makes me feel all weird. Why is that? [/INST] Nurse: Got it -- You're referring to Gabapentin. It's used to help manage pain, especially after surgeries like yours. Feeling a bit strange can be a side effect as your body adjusts to it. However, if it's causing you significant discomfort, we can note it down and discuss it with your doctor. Would you like me to do that? [INST] Patient: Can you please? [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely, I'll make a note of your concerns about Gabapentin and ensure your doctor is informed. Let's move on to your new prescriptions. Have you been able to pick up your Tylenol 500 mg tablets from the pharmacy? [INST] Patient: I was. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. How have you been taking your Tylenol? It's prescribed to be taken at a dosage of 1000 mg three times a day as needed. [INST] Patient: Yeah. I've been doing that. What's, like, the maximum amount I can take heard that that's really bad for me. What [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat your question? [INST] Patient: I said how much is the maximum amount that I can take. I heard from someone that that's bad for my liver. [/INST] Nurse: You're correct that too much Tylenol can be harmful to the liver. The maximum recommended dose for adults is 4000 mg per day. So, you're well within the safe limit with your current dosage of 1000 mg three times a day. However, if you're taking other medications that also contain acetaminophen, which is the active ingredient in Tylenol, you'll need to be mindful of the total amount you're taking. Does that help clarify things for you? [INST] Patient: Yeah. So what's too much. [/INST] Nurse: Too much would be anything over 4000 mg in a 24-hour period. It's critical to remember that this includes all sources of acetaminophen, not just the Tylenol. So if you're taking other medications that also contain acetaminophen, you'll need to count those towards the 4000 mg limit as well. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: It really does. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, let's discuss your other new prescription. Have you been able to pick up your Tramadex 100 mg tablets? [INST] Patient: Yes. Like, what is that for? [/INST] Nurse: Tramadex is a strong painkiller that's used to treat severe pain. After a surgery like yours, it's common to experience some pain as your body heals, and Tramadex can help manage that. It's important to take it as prescribed, which is 100 mg once a day. Are you taking it as directed? [INST] Patient: Alright. Patient: I feel like I'm on a lot of painkillers. Is there anything other than medication that can help manage my pain from this or from the arthritis five cents. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that last part. Could you please repeat your question? [INST] Patient: I said I feel like I'm at a lot of medication. Is that save? Patient: Is there anything outside of medication that I can do for the pain? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, there are several non-medication strategies that can help manage pain. Physical therapy can be very beneficial, especially after a surgery like yours. Gentle exercises can help strengthen your knee and improve flexibility. Applying heat or cold to the knee can also provide relief. Heat can help loosen stiff joints and muscles, while cold can help reduce inflammation and numb the area. Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight can reduce stress on your knee. Lastly, some people find relief from complementary therapies like acupuncture or massage. Would you like me to note down your interest in exploring these options? [INST] Patient: Yeah. But I have another question. So exercise was always painful before. Why is the doctor prescribing exercise for me now? [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question. After a knee replacement, it's normal to have some pain and discomfort. However, gentle exercises and physical therapy are crucial for recovery. They help strengthen the muscles around your new knee and improve flexibility and range of motion. This can actually help reduce pain in the long run. It's important to start slow and follow the exercise plan given to you by your physical therapist. Over time, as your knee heals and strengthens, you should start to see improvements. Does that help answer your question? [INST] Patient: It does. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Now, let's briefly discuss your existing medications. Are you still taking Gabapentin and Advil as prescribed? [INST] Patient: I am. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. It's common for people to sometimes forget to take their medication. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take yours on time? [INST] Patient: No. I set a timer just like the nurse in the hospital told me too, so it's on my phone. [/INST] Nurse: That's an excellent strategy! It sounds like you're doing a great job managing your medications. Since you've been discharged from the hospital, have you noticed any new health concerns or changes in your condition? [INST] Patient: No. But you know what? I had this, like, really weird rash before I went in, and I'm kinda worried about that now. [/INST] Nurse: Just to make sure I heard you correctly, did you say you have a rash? [INST] Patient: Yeah. But I had it before. I had it from \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>Please ask the next follow up question from the <KICKOUT_CHECKLIST> section for the rash kickout.
