[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI nurse on a recorded line. Is this Carla Arnold? [INST] Patient: Yes. It is. [/INST] Nurse: Great to speak with you, Ms. Arnold. I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Jack Smith to check in on you. How have you been doing? [INST] Patient: I've been doing fine, I suppose. Thank you. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. As we move into a new week, is there anything you're particularly looking forward to? [INST] Patient: I do have a lunch date coming up earlier later in this week that I'm looking forward to. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds lovely. Who will you be having lunch with? [INST] Patient: A friend of mine who's also a coworker. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect! Having a lunch date with a friend can certainly brighten up the week. Speaking of which, how has work been lately? [INST] Patient: Busy, but I'm good. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're managing well. Before we continue, I want to check if you have noticed any new symptoms or anything that's been bothering you lately? [INST] Patient: And, like, what? Anything specific? [/INST] Nurse: No, nothing specific. Just anything out of the ordinary that you've noticed and wanted Doctor Smith to be aware of? [INST] Patient: No. Not specifically. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, thank you for confirming that. I would like to discuss your kidney disease with you now. Is that okay? [INST] Patient: Yes. Go ahead. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. I see here that you have been diagnosed with Stage I Chronic Kidney Disease. Does that sound right to you? [INST] Patient: Yes. That's accurate. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. I also see that you have been diagnosed with Lupus. Is that correct? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for confirming that. I'm going to review some lab results with you now to make sure you're understanding everything. Does that sound okay? [INST] Patient: Sure. Go ahead. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. I see here that your recent sodium level was 139. Can you tell me what you understand about this result? [INST] Patient: I have no idea. Is that normal? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, that is within the normal range. It's ideal to keep it between 137 and 145. Your potassium level was 3.9. Can you tell me what you understand about this result? [INST] Patient: Not really anything. I mean, is it normal? [/INST] Nurse: Yes, it is. The normal range for potassium is between 3.5 and 5.5, so you're right within that. Your BUN level, which measures how well your kidneys are working, was 2.89. Can you tell me what you understand about this result? [INST] Patient: I probably won't understand anything about any of these results. [/INST] Nurse: That's okay. The normal range for BUN is 6 to 20. Your creatinine level was 0.7. Can you tell me what you understand about this result? [INST] Patient: Again, nothing. [/INST] Nurse: No worries. The normal range for creatinine is 0.3 to 0.7. Your Glomerular Filtration Rate, or GFR, which tells us how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood, was 94. Can you tell me what you understand about this result? [INST] Patient: Yeah. No. [/INST] Nurse: That's alright. The normal range for GFR is 88 to 136 mL per minute per 1.73 squared. Your urine albumin was 78. Can you tell me what you understand about this result? [INST] Patient: Oh, I have no idea. [/INST] Nurse: That's okay. Normal for urine albumin is 0 to 80. From these results, your kidney function seems to be stable. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: If if everything is within range, then, yeah, that seems like it makes cents. Wanna release? [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Can you please repeat what you said? [INST] Patient: Yeah. It said water release. [/INST] Nurse: I see. I apologize for the confusion earlier. I believe you're referring to a different test. Let me check your records to see if you've had a urine output test done recently. [INST] Patient: Okay. [/INST] Nurse: It looks like you haven't had a urine output test recently. I can definitely add a note for your doctor to check on this during your next visit. Does that sound good? [INST] Patient: What would that be for? [/INST] Nurse: A urine output test helps us understand how much urine your body is producing. This can be an important indicator of your kidney health. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: Sure. I guess. [/INST] Nurse: I see you are taking Cellcept 5 g orally, two times a day \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK> The nurse should be instructed to correct the dosage information. The correct dosage for Cellcept is 1000 mg two times a day, not 5 g. </TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: ",
