        "G15": "I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Jimenez. Atorvastatin is a medication used to lower cholesterol levels. It's not associated with turning your urine brown or causing muscle pain and weakness. The most common side effects are muscle pain, joint pain, and weakness. If you experience any of these, please let your doctor know. Now, let's move on to your new medications. Have you picked up your new prescriptions for Lasix and Lisinopril?",
        "G15DPO": "I apologize for any confusion. To clarify, when taking Atorvastatin, you should not expect your urine to turn a brown muddy color or to have bad muscle pain and weakness. These are not common side effects of this medication.",
        "gpt4": "I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Jimenez. The information I provided earlier about Atorvastatin was incorrect. While taking Atorvastatin, you should not expect your urine to turn a brown muddy color or experience severe muscle pain and weakness. These are not typical side effects. However, if you do experience any unusual symptoms, please let your doctor know immediately. Now, let's move on to your new medications. Have you picked up your new prescriptions for Lasix and Lisinopril?"
