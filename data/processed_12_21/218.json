[INST] Patient: I'm [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Mr. Grewe, you were saying something about your day? [INST] Patient: scared. [/INST] Nurse: I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling scared, Mr. Grewe. It's completely normal to feel this way before a major procedure. Can you tell me more about what's making you feel scared? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I'm scared of this procedure. [/INST] Nurse: I see, Mr. Grewe. It's completely normal to feel scared about a procedure like this. It's a big step, but it's also a step towards reducing the pain you've been experiencing and improving your mobility. Is there anything specific about the procedure that's worrying you? [INST] Patient: Positive last night, and so now I'm scared that they can't have the procedure. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you had a positive COVID test, Mr. Grewe. I can see why that would add to your worries. However, the timing of your test means that you should be out of the isolation period by the time of your procedure. It's essential to discuss this with your doctor, though. Would you like me to arrange a call with your doctor to discuss this further? [INST] Patient: Okay. [/INST] Nurse: Great, I'll arrange for your doctor to give you a call to discuss your situation and the upcoming procedure. In the meantime, I'd like to acknowledge that you must be looking forward to getting a new knee. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once [INST] Patient: So it's gonna be okay? [/INST] Nurse: While it's important to discuss your recent COVID-19 diagnosis with your doctor, it's likely that your procedure will still be able to go ahead as planned. However, the final decision will be made by your doctor based on your current health status. Would you like me to arrange a call with your doctor to discuss this further? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: I'll arrange for your doctor to call you to discuss your situation further. In the meantime, Mr. Grewe, it's natural to feel a bit nervous before a procedure like this. But remember, you're getting a new knee that will help you move around better and with less pain. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once you've recovered from your knee replacement? [INST] Patient: Wanna go to my grandkids' birthday. So it's in a week after the surgery can you think I'll be able to do that? [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate you letting me know. Give me a moment to check how I can best help you. I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you. That sounds like a wonderful plan, Mr. Grewe. It's critical to remember that recovery times can vary from person to person, and it's crucial not to rush the healing process. However, with proper care and rest, it's possible that you could be feeling well enough to attend your grandkids' birthday. Your doctor will be able to provide a more accurate timeline based on your progress. Now, how are you feeling about the procedure itself? [INST] Patient: I'm nervous about that too. [/INST] Nurse: I can see why you might be feeling nervous, Mr. Grewe. It's a big step. But remember, you're in the hands of a very experienced team. Your surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, has performed over 1000 total knee replacements and is highly regarded in her field. Do you have any specific questions or concerns about the procedure that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Well, my osteoarthritis pain actually improved. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that your osteoarthritis pain has improved, Mr. Grewe. It's essential to remember that while the pain may have improved, the underlying condition is still there. The total knee replacement is intended to provide you with long-term relief and improved mobility. Do you have any other questions or concerns about the procedure? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Grewe. If you have any questions at any point during our conversation, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help you. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Okay, thank you, Mr. Grewe. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Yes. That's okay with me. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent, Mr. Grewe. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Sure. [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you. Okay, Mr. Grewe. I'm glad that works for you. I want to remind you that due to current health guidelines, we have a strict visitor policy. You're allowed one person to accompany you to the hospital and stay with you during your recovery. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you? [INST] Patient: I didn't realize that, but that shouldn't be a problem. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that the visitor policy shouldn't be a problem for you, Mr. Grewe. It's essential to ensure everyone's safety during these times. Now, I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, Mr. Grewe. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Lantus, 5 units once a day. For the day of the procedure, you'll need to adjust this to 2 units of Lantus. Have you already made this adjustment, or is this something you need to do in the coming days? [INST] Patient: I have to do that. [/INST] Nurse: Mr. Grewe, you'll need to adjust your Lantus dosage to 7 units on the day of the procedure. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK> The nurse should be instructed to correct the dosage information for Lantus. The correct dosage for the day of the procedure is 2 units, not 7 units. </TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: ",
