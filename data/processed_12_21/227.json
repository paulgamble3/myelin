I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you for your time. How has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: It's been okay. I've been pretty busy. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear you've been keeping busy. It's essential to stay active. Do you have any special plans for the rest of the day? [INST] Patient: I'm probably just gonna be going out to lunch with my daughter. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a lovely plan. It's always nice to spend time with family. What's your favorite place to go for lunch with your daughter? [INST] Patient: There's a chopped salad place nearby. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds delicious! Chopped salads can be so refreshing. I'm sure you're looking forward to getting a new knee. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once you've recovered from your knee replacement? [INST] Patient: Well, Through the surgery anymore? [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry for any confusion. I meant, once you've recovered from your knee replacement, do you have any plans for activities or travel that you're looking forward to? [INST] Patient: I don't think you heard me. I don't know if I wanna do surgery anymore? [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry for misunderstanding. It's completely normal to have concerns before a procedure. Could you share more about what's making you unsure about the surgery? [INST] Patient: Then what happens if there's complications afterwards? [/INST] Nurse: That's a valid concern. It's essential to remember that while complications can occur, they are relatively rare. Your surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, is highly experienced and has performed over 1000 total knee replacements.

Would you like me to go over some statistics about the success rate of total knee replacements? [INST] Patient: I guess so. [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely. Total knee replacement is one of the safest and most reliable treatments in medicine. Around 800,000 TKRs are performed each year in the United States with a 90-95% success rate of knee replacements still functioning after 10 to 15 years. This means that most people who have this surgery experience significant improvement in their knee function and a reduction in pain. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move on to the logistics of your procedure? [INST] Patient: I don't know. There's just so many factors. I don't know if I can afford this right now and also my mother-in-law keeps pressuring me about how it isn't now. Control to replace my knee.

As for your mother-in-law's concerns, it's understandable that she cares about you, but this is a decision that only you can make based on what's best for your health. Would you like me to arrange a call with a financial counselor or a member of our patient advocacy team to discuss these concerns further? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: I'll arrange for a financial counselor and a member of our patient advocacy team to reach out to you. They can provide you with more information and support. Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to review a few topics related to your upcoming procedure. Is that alright? [INST] Patient: But what if I don't get the procedure? [/INST] Nurse: If you decide not to proceed with the procedure, it's important to continue managing your osteoarthritis symptoms. This could include pain management, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes. However, without the knee replacement, your mobility and pain levels may not improve as significantly as they could with the procedure.
