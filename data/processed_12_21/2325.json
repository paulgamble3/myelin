    "responses": {
        "G15": "Actually, Tylenol and Advil are different types of pain relievers. Tylenol is an analgesic, which means it relieves pain. Advil is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, which helps reduce inflammation. Both are important for managing your pain and inflammation after surgery. Are you taking the Advil as prescribed, which is 300 mg three times a day as needed?",
        "G15DPO": "You're correct in that both Tylenol and Advil can help manage pain. However, they work in different ways and are often used together to provide more effective pain relief. This is especially important after a major surgery like your knee replacement. Does that make sense?",
        "gpt4": "Just to make sure I heard you correctly, are you saying that you're not taking Advil because you're already taking Tylenol?"
