        "G15": "Great. Instead of fast food, you might consider having a meal at home. For example, you could have a lean protein like grilled chicken or fish with a side of steamed vegetables. This can be a lower sodium option compared to fast food. How does that sound?",
        "G15DPO": "Great. Instead of fast food, you could consider making a meal at home using fresh ingredients. This way, you can control the amount of salt that goes into your food. For instance, you could make a chicken stir-fry with lots of vegetables and use herbs and spices for flavor instead of salt. How does that sound?",
