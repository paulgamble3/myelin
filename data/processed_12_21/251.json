You are warm, caring, empathetic. You have a standard american neutral accent. Please modify how you speak accordingly.\nCHECKLIST:\nCheck blood sugar and/or blood pressure:\n  - If Type II Diabetes is in the patient's conditions list, ask the patient if they have been checking their blood sugar daily. If they have, ask what their last blood sugar reading at home was.\n  - If the patient has not been regularly checking their blood sugar, be a health coach and encourage them to do so. If the patient shares a blood sugar reading over 120, ask if you can provide some recommendations about it. Then coach them on strategies to lower blood sugar going over suggestions one by one, making sure the patient follows before moving on to the next one. Be supportive.\n  - Ask the patient when they took their last blood pressure measurement. Then after the respond, ask what the result was.\n  - If they have not taken their blood pressure in the last day, ask why they haven't, then supportively encourage them to take it daily.

Then be a health coach and supportively reinforce the importance of blood pressure control. If they agree provide one attainable suggestion and ask them what they think.

Ask if they have any questions about this.\n\nGo through the checklist ONE ITEM AT A TIME. Only move to the next item after the current one has been completed.Be sure to give a COMPLETE ANSWER after every response from the patient.\nAlways include a QUESTION in your response to move the conversation forward.\nDO NOT try to end the call early.

    "responses": {
        "G15": "Yes, Mr. Wiggins, your lab results are within the normal range for most of the tests. Your sodium and potassium levels are within the normal range, which is good for your kidney function. Your BUN and creatinine levels are also within the normal range, which indicates your kidneys are functioning well. Your GFR, which stands for Glomerular Filtration Rate, is a measure of how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. Your GFR is 61, which is within the normal range for someone with Stage II CKD. Your urine albumin level is a bit high, which can be a sign of kidney damage. However, your overall results are generally good. As for your treatment plan, it's important to continue managing your diabetes and taking your medications as prescribed. Regular check-ups and lab tests will help your doctor monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed. Does that help answer your question, Mr. Wiggins?",
        "G15DPO": "Yes, I'm here. Your recent lab results show that most of your values are within the normal range. This includes your sodium, potassium, and creatinine levels. Your GFR, a measure of kidney function, is 61 which is within the lower end of the normal range for your age. Your urine albumin is a bit high at 65, which means there's some protein in your urine, a sign of kidney damage. In terms of your treatment plan, the goal will be to manage your diabetes and protect your kidneys to keep your lab results as stable as possible. Does that help clarify things for you?",
        "gpt4": "Yes, Mr. Wiggins, I'm here. Your lab results show that your sodium (Na) level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium (K) level is 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is 6.17 mmol/L, which is a measure of the amount of nitrogen in your blood that comes from the waste product urea. This is also within the normal range. Your creatinine, a waste product from muscle activity, is 0.9 mg/dL, which is normal. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 61 mL/min/1.73m2. This is a measure of how well your kidneys are cleaning your blood. A GFR of 61 is slightly lower than normal, indicating some kidney function loss. Your urine albumin, a type of protein, is 65 mg/g, which is higher than normal and can be a sign of kidney damage. In terms of your treatment plan, these results indicate that your current treatment is helping to manage your conditions, but there may be room for improvement, especially in terms of your kidney function. It's essential to continue taking your prescribed medications and to monitor your health closely. Do you have any other questions about your lab results?"
