Hematocrit: This measures what portion of your total blood volume is made up of red blood cells. The safe range is usually between 36 to 48%.

Each of these components provides valuable information about your overall health. Would you like to know more about any of these components, Ms. Phan? [INST] Patient: No. Thanks. [/INST] Nurse: ",
