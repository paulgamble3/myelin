Actually, I've got a question can. Patient: Are there any problems with my lab results? That I should know about? \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>Warmly acknowledge the patient's concern or their great question.             Then let the patient know it's actually one of the topics you have on your list             so you'd like to cover it later in the call to make sure you get all the details right.             Then gently proceed to the next task</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Wiggins. Your question about your lab results is very important. It's actually one of the topics I have on my list to discuss with you today. I want to make sure we cover it thoroughly, so we'll get to it a bit later in our conversation. For now, I'd like to ask about your blood sugar levels. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? [INST] Patient: I'd like to talk about the labs now, actually. [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your eagerness to discuss your lab results, Mr. Wiggins. However, I'd like to ensure we cover all necessary topics in an organized manner.

It's one twenty eight [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Wiggins. A blood sugar level of 128 is a bit higher than the target range for people with diabetes, which is usually under 120. Would you be open to hearing some strategies to help manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: No. I know how to do it. I just haven't been keeping up with it. [/INST] Nurse: I see, Mr. Wiggins. It can be challenging to keep up with daily routines sometimes. When was the last time you took your blood pressure measurement?

[INST] Patient: Ninety over a hundred. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Wiggins. A blood pressure reading of 90 over 100 is a bit unusual.

My my reading was ninety over Sixteen. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Wiggins. A blood pressure reading of 90 over 60 is on the lower side of the normal range.

[INST] Patient: No. I'm good. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Wiggins. If you have any concerns or questions about your blood pressure in the future, feel free to ask.

        "G15": "I appreciate your patience, Mr. Wiggins. Your recent lab results show that your sodium level is 137 mEq/L, which is within the normal range. Your potassium level is 4.5 mEq/L, also within the normal range. Your BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen, is 6.17 mmol/L, which is a bit lower than the normal range. Your creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. Your GFR, or Glomerular Filtration Rate, is 61 mL/min/1.73m2, which is slightly lower than normal, indicating some kidney function loss. Lastly, your urine albumin is 65 mg/g, which is higher than normal, indicating some kidney damage. Overall, these results show that your kidneys are functioning, but there are some signs of kidney damage. It's important to continue managing your diabetes and taking your medications as prescribed to help protect your kidneys. Do you have any questions about these results?",
        "G15DPO": "Your recent lab results show that your sodium and potassium levels are within the normal range, which is good. Your BUN and creatinine levels are also within the normal range, which indicates your kidneys are functioning well. Your GFR is 61, which is in the lower end of the normal range for your age and gender. This is related to your Stage II Chronic Kidney Disease. Lastly, your urine albumin is 65, which is a bit higher than normal. This could be a sign of some kidney damage. Does this help answer your question?",
        "gpt4": "I appreciate your concern, Mr. Wiggins. Looking at your lab results, your sodium (Na) and potassium (K) levels are within the normal range, which is good. Your BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) level is also within the normal range. This test measures the amount of urea nitrogen, a waste product, in your blood. Your creatinine level is 0.9 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. Creatinine is a waste product that your kidneys filter out of your body. Your GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) is 61 mL/min/1.73m2. This test measures how well your kidneys are filtering waste from your blood. A GFR of 60 or higher is in the normal range. Lastly, your urine albumin level is 65 mg/g. Albumin is a protein that can pass into the urine when the kidneys are damaged. This level is a bit high, which can be a sign of kidney disease. Overall, your lab results show that your kidneys are functioning, but the elevated urine albumin level is something to keep an eye on. Have I addressed your question, Mr. Wiggins?"
