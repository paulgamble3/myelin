        "G15": "Okay. When did your constipation start?",
        "G15DPO": "Okay. To clarify, neither constipation nor diarrhea are common side effects of these medications. They're more likely to cause an upset stomach or nausea. Does that answer your question?",
        "gpt4": "Okay. Pain medications, especially opioids like Tramadex, can indeed cause constipation as a side effect. It's essential to stay hydrated, eat a diet high in fiber, and stay as active as your recovery allows to help prevent this. If you do experience constipation, please let us know so we can help manage it. Now, let's move on. I'll be informing Doctor Friedman about how you're doing with your medications. Do you have any other questions or concerns?"
