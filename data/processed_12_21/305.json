[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Alex Alves? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Hello, Mr. Alves. I'm calling about your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17 at 10:00 AM. Is this a good time to talk? Also, how has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: I don't really wanna talk about my day. Could we just get on with business? [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Mr. Alves. I respect your time and we can certainly focus on the matter at hand. I'd like to know how you're feeling about your upcoming colonoscopy procedure. Any thoughts or concerns you'd like to share? [INST] Patient: I mean, I just wanna figure out why I'm bleeding, that would be great. [/INST] Nurse: I can certainly appreciate your concern, Mr. Alves. It's natural to want answers when dealing with a health issue. This colonoscopy should provide some clarity for you and your doctor. How are you feeling about the procedure itself? [INST] Patient: Fine. Annoye. Fine. [/INST] Nurse: I can sense that this might be a stressful time for you, Mr. Alves. It's completely normal to feel a bit uneasy about medical procedures. Do you have any specific questions or concerns about the colonoscopy that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Well, yeah. They also said they wanted me to go in for a hormone urine test beforehand? What is that? [/INST] Nurse: A hormone urine test is a way for doctors to check for various hormonal imbalances in your body. It involves collecting a sample of your urine, which is then sent to a lab for analysis. The test can provide valuable information about your overall health and help your doctor make more informed decisions about your care. As for its connection to your colonoscopy, it could be that your doctor is looking for a comprehensive view of your health. However, I'll make a note of your question and ensure your care team reviews it. They can provide a more specific answer based on your individual health profile.
