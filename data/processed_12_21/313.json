It's also a good choice for someone with knee issues, as it's low impact. Just remember to take it easy, especially while you're not feeling well. Once you're feeling better and after your knee replacement, you'll likely be able to get back to it. Have you been able to use your bike recently, or has your current illness made that too difficult?"
