        "G15": "I see, Ms. Winner. Your hemoglobin A1C level is a bit higher than the normal range. This is a common concern for people with diabetes. It's a measure of your average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months. A higher level can indicate that your blood sugar has been higher than the target range. However, it's something that can be managed with your current medications and lifestyle changes. Would you like some tips on how to manage your blood sugar levels?",
        "G15DPO": "Your Hemoglobin A1C of 7 falls within the safe range. This number gives us an idea of your average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months. In the context of your upcoming procedure, it's a good sign that your blood sugar levels have been within a healthy range. Does that help alleviate some of your concerns about your lab results?",
        "gpt4": "I see, Ms. Winner. It's natural to have questions about lab results. Your Hemoglobin A1C level of 7 is within the safe range, which is between 4.7 and 8.5. This test gives us an idea of your average blood sugar levels over the past few months. It's a key measure we look at for managing diabetes. Does that help clarify things a bit?"
