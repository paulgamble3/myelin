How has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: My day's been pretty good. I do have a lot of anxiety and fear about this upcoming procedure [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear your day has been good. It's completely normal to feel anxious and fearful before a procedure like a total knee replacement. Can you tell me more about what's causing your anxiety? [INST] Patient: I just I guess I'm afraid it's not gonna work. I'll still be in a lot of pain. Like, from any more years, And it's always a little scary when you go under general anesthesia. [/INST] Nurse: It's completely normal to have these concerns. [INST] Patient: You know? [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely, it's natural to have such concerns. The goal of a total knee replacement is to relieve the pain in your knee caused by damage to the joint. It's one of the most reliable treatments in medicine with a high success rate.

It's a simple pleasure that we often take for granted. Do you have a favorite place or route you're excited to walk again without pain? [INST] Patient: Cool. I just walked around my neighborhood. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds lovely. Walking in your neighborhood can be a great way to enjoy the outdoors and stay active. It's a goal worth looking forward to. Now, let's move on to some logistics.
