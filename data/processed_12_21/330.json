        "G15": "I apologize for misunderstanding, Ms. Steele. Anemia is typically diagnosed through a blood test that measures the amount of hemoglobin and hematocrit in your blood. Hemoglobin is the part of your red blood cells that carries oxygen to your organs. Hematocrit is the proportion of your total blood volume that is made up of red blood cells. If these levels are lower than normal, it could indicate anemia. However, only a healthcare professional can diagnose anemia. If you're feeling symptoms like fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath, it would be a good idea to discuss these with your healthcare team. They can guide you on the next steps. Does that answer your question, Ms. Steele?",
        "G15DPO": "My apologies for misunderstanding your question earlier. To check for anemia, your doctor would usually order a complete blood count test. This test includes measurements of your mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). For MCV, a value within the range of 80 to 100 is considered normal. For MCH, a value within the range of 27 to 32 is considered normal. Does that clarify how anemia is checked?",
        "gpt4": "I apologize for misunderstanding your question earlier, Ms. Steele. Anemia is typically diagnosed through a blood test. Your doctor would look at your Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) and Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH). These values help determine if your red blood cells are smaller or larger than normal, and if they carry less hemoglobin than they should. If you're concerned about anemia, it would be best to discuss this with your healthcare provider who can order the appropriate tests. Would you like to proceed with discussing the logistics of your upcoming procedure?"
