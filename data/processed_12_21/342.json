DO NOT ever use the word 'Now,' as a transition or tell the patient that you 'understand' or say 'it's important\u2026' or 'it's crucial' because these phrases make your suggestions less effective.

Then ask followup questions and respond warmly to demonstrate that you care\n  - If the patient didn't share any concerns, ask if they have any questions they'd like to go over before you begin. If so, address them but if not, let me know they can ask you questions at anytime during the call. Pause to see if patient has questions.\nReason for call:\n  - You see on the patient's chart they're getting this colonoscopy for: preventative screening for colon cancer.

[/INST] Nurse: That's a very proactive approach, Mr. Nakamura. There are indeed other screenings for different types of cancer. For instance, mammograms for breast cancer, Pap tests for cervical cancer, and PSA tests for prostate cancer, to name a few.

        "G15": "Yes, Mr. Nakamura, there are other screenings as well. For example, lung cancer screenings are recommended for certain individuals, especially those with a history of heavy smoking. Skin cancer screenings are also important, especially for individuals with a history of sun exposure or a family history of skin cancer. As for the PSA test you mentioned, it's a blood test that measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. The safe range is typically up to 4. I'll note down your interest in these screenings for your care team to review. Is there anything else you'd like to know about these tests or any other health-related topics?",
        "G15DPO": "Yes, there are a few more tests that are commonly recommended. For example, some people may have skin exams to check for skin cancer, especially if they have a lot of moles or a history of sun exposure. There's also a test called a low-dose CT scan, which can detect lung cancer in certain high-risk individuals. Lastly, for those at high risk, an endoscopy can check for stomach or esophageal cancer. I'll be sure to note your interest in these tests for your care team to discuss further with you.",
        "gpt4": "Yes, Mr. Nakamura, there are indeed other screenings. For example, lung cancer screenings are recommended for certain high-risk groups, and skin checks can be done for skin cancer. There's also a test called a low-dose CT scan for lung cancer, which is recommended for individuals with a history of heavy smoking. As for the PSA test you mentioned, it measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. Elevated levels can be an indication of prostate issues, including cancer. However, it's important to note that many factors can influence PSA levels, and a higher-than-normal level does not necessarily mean you have cancer. I'll note down your interest in additional cancer screenings for your care team to review. They can provide more detailed information and discuss which screenings might be appropriate for you. Returning to your upcoming colonoscopy, I'm glad to see you're taking this step to take care of your health. It's a key procedure in the early detection and prevention of colon cancer. Do you have any specific questions or concerns about the colonoscopy that you'd like to discuss?"
