        "G15": "I can certainly appreciate your concerns, Ms. Raynier. It's natural to worry about potential complications, especially given your previous experience with a stroke. Before any surgery, including a total knee replacement, your medical team will conduct a series of tests to ensure you're in the best possible health for the procedure. These tests often include blood tests to check your hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, and platelet count. These tests help your doctors assess your overall health and identify any potential risks. As for predicting a stroke, it's a complex process that involves many factors. Your medical team will consider your overall health, your medical history, and the specifics of your upcoming surgery to minimize any potential risks. Would you like to discuss any other concerns or questions you might have?",
        "G15DPO": "Those are valid concerns, Ms. Raynier. In the lead up to surgery, your medical team will run a series of tests to assess your overall health and identify any potential risks. These tests often include blood tests to check your blood count, clotting factors, and other indicators of your body's ability to heal and recover from surgery. While these tests can't predict with certainty if you'll have another stroke, they do provide valuable information to help manage your care and reduce risks. Does that help alleviate some of your worries?",
        "gpt4": "I can see why you might be concerned, Ms. Raynier, especially given your previous experience with a stroke. It's natural to want to understand all the risks involved. Before your surgery, your medical team will indeed run a series of lab tests, including a complete blood count. This test will check your hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, and platelet count. These values help your medical team assess your overall health and readiness for surgery. While these tests don't predict the likelihood of a stroke, they do provide valuable information about your overall health status. Your medical team will use this information, along with your medical history, to take all necessary precautions to minimize any risks associated with the surgery. As for the relationship between surgery and stroke, while there is a risk, it's generally very low. Your medical team, including your surgeon Doctor Cristina Stevens, are highly experienced and will be taking all necessary steps to ensure your safety. Does that help address your concern, Ms. Raynier?"
