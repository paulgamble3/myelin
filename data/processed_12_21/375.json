[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this David Grewe? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Hello, Mr. Grewe. I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I'm glad you called because been wondering if they're gonna do lab work when I have my knee replacement. [/INST] Nurse: Absolutely, Mr. Grewe. It's common to have some lab work done before a surgery like a total knee replacement. This is to ensure your overall health is in a good state for the procedure. The specific tests can vary, but they often include blood tests to check for things like blood count, clotting factors, and electrolyte levels. By the way, how has your day been going so far? [INST] Patient: Just fine. Do you know what they do as CBC? \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>The safe range for hemoglobin is 13 to 17 g/dL.. The safe range for hematocrit is 40 to 55 %.. The safe range for wbc is 4 to 11 x10^9/L .. The safe range for platelets is 150 to 400 x10^9/L .\nDon't specify unit unless patient asks for it.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: Yes, Mr. Grewe. A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a common blood test that gives doctors information about three types of cells in your blood: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. Two important measurements in the CBC related to red blood cells are hemoglobin and hematocrit. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. [INST] Patient: Oh, good. What is Yeah. Tell me what that is. [/INST] Nurse: ",

    "responses": {
        "G15": "Sure, Mr. Grewe. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The safe range for hemoglobin is typically between 13 to 17. Hematocrit, on the other hand, is the proportion of your total blood volume that is made up of red blood cells. The safe range for hematocrit is usually between 40 to 55%. These tests help ensure your body is ready for surgery by checking if your red blood cells are functioning properly. White blood cells, another component of the CBC, are part of your immune system and help your body fight off infections. The safe range for white blood cells is typically between 4 to 11. Lastly, platelets are small blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. The safe range for platelets is usually between 150 to 400. These tests are important to ensure your body can heal properly after surgery. Do you have any other questions about the CBC or anything else related to your upcoming procedure?",
        "G15DPO": "Certainly, Mr. Grewe. Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. It also brings carbon dioxide back to your lungs so you can exhale it out. Hematocrit, on the other hand, is a measure of how much space your red blood cells take up in your blood. Both of these values help your doctor understand how well your body is delivering oxygen. Does that help clarify things?",
        "gpt4": "A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a blood test that gives doctors information about three types of cells in your blood: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. The test measures the amount of these cells, and checks their health and lifespan. White blood cells are part of your immune system, and help your body fight off infections. The test counts how many you have. Platelets are tiny blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. The test measures how many platelets you have. Each of these components has a safe range. For example, the safe range for red blood cells, which is measured by hemoglobin, is 13 to 17. For white blood cells, the safe range is 4 to 11. And for platelets, the safe range is 150 to 400. I hope this helps! Is there anything else you're curious about regarding your upcoming procedure or anything else?"
