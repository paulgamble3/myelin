        "gpt4": "I'm glad to hear you've picked up your medications, Mr. Forbes. However, I think there may be a misunderstanding. Both your Valsartan and Lasix should be taken orally, not rectally. The correct dosage for Valsartan is 80mg two times a day, and for Lasix, it's 20mg two times a day. Are you able to follow this regimen?"
