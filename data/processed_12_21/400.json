        "G15": "I can see why you might be worried, Ms. McKloskey. It's natural to have concerns when facing new health challenges. As for your question, there are tests that can help detect certain types of cancer. For example, a carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test can be used to help detect certain types of cancer, including stomach cancer. The safe range for CEA varies depending on whether you smoke. If you don't smoke, the safe range is 0 to 3. If you do smoke, the safe range is 0 to 5. There are also other tests like CA 125 and CA 15-3 that can be used in certain situations. However, it's important to remember that these tests are not definitive and are usually used in conjunction with other diagnostic methods. Do you smoke, Ms. McKloskey?",
        "G15DPO": "I can see why you might be worried. It's completely normal to have concerns about your health. There are tests that can help detect certain types of stomach cancer. One such test measures the levels of a protein called carcinoembryonic antigen in your blood. The safe range for this test can vary based on your smoking habits. Would you mind sharing if you currently smoke?",
        "gpt4": "I can see why you might be worried, Ms. McKloskey. It's natural to fear the worst when we're not feeling well. However, it's important to remember that IBS is a common condition and it's much more likely to be the cause of your symptoms than something like stomach cancer. That being said, if you're concerned, it's always a good idea to discuss these fears with your healthcare provider. They can order tests if necessary to rule out other conditions. By the way, do you smoke, Ms. McKloskey? This information can help us understand your overall health better."
