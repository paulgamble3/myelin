If they have, ask what their last blood sugar reading at home was.\n  - If the patient has not been regularly checking their blood sugar, be a health coach and encourage them to do so.

These are both important electrolytes that help your body function properly. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your lab results?",
        "G15DPO": "Of course, Ms. Arnold. Your recent lab results show that your sodium levels are within the normal range at 139. Your potassium levels are also within the normal range at 3.9. These are both good signs for your overall health. I hope we can continue to discuss your lab results and any other questions you have throughout our call. Is there anything specific you've been enjoying lately or any hobbies you've been spending time on?",
