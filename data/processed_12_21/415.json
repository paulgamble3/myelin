[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Trisha Raynier? [INST] Patient: Yes. It is. [/INST] Nurse: Hello, Ms. Raynier. I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Yes. It is. [/INST] Nurse: Fantastic, Ms. Raynier. I hope your day is going well. Can you share a bit about how your day has been so far? [INST] Patient: It's been very good. I actually went and had breakfast. Fist with my best friend. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds delightful, Ms. Raynier. Breakfast with a friend is always a great way to start the day. What did you have for breakfast? [INST] Patient: I had some lovely pancakes. [/INST] Nurse: Pancakes are a delightful choice, Ms. Raynier. Do you have a favorite type of pancake or topping you enjoy? [INST] Patient: Well, I love strawberries, but I also love chocolate chocolate chip pancakes. [/INST] Nurse: Oh, both strawberries and chocolate chip pancakes sound delicious, Ms. Raynier. It's nice to have a variety in our meals. Speaking of variety, I imagine you're looking forward to having a new knee. What are you planning to do once your knee is better? [INST] Patient: I want to be able to go biking, I wanna be able to go hiking, all of that stuff outdoor things. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds wonderful, Ms. Raynier. Outdoor activities like biking and hiking can be so enjoyable and beneficial for our health. Do you have a favorite place to bike or hike that you're excited to visit again? [INST] Patient: Oh, we have many bike trails around our house. And lots of hiking in the Shenandoah Mountains. [/INST] Nurse: The Shenandoah Mountains are indeed a beautiful place to hike, Ms. Raynier. The bike trails around your house must also be quite convenient. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure? [INST] Patient: I'm quite excited. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're excited, Ms. Raynier. It's a big step towards getting back to the activities you love. Before we delve into the details of your procedure, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: I do. I have some labs done, but I don't understand all of this. Stuff. [/INST] Nurse: I see, Ms. Raynier. Lab results can sometimes be a bit confusing. While I can't interpret your lab results, I can certainly help you understand what they generally mean and why they are important for your upcoming procedure. Would you like me to explain that? [INST] Patient: Yes, please. [/INST] Nurse: Certainly, Ms. Raynier. Lab tests are a crucial part of the preoperative process. They help your healthcare team assess your overall health and readiness for surgery. Some common preoperative tests include a complete blood count, coagulation tests, and kidney and liver function tests. A complete blood count, or CBC, measures the number of different types of cells in your blood, such as red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can help identify conditions like anemia or infections that might need to be addressed before surgery. Coagulation tests measure how well your blood clots, which is important to know before any surgery to assess your risk of bleeding. Kidney and liver function tests assess how well these organs are working. These organs help process medications used during surgery, so it's important to ensure they're functioning well. These are just a few examples, and the specific tests you had may vary. The results of these tests help your healthcare team plan for your surgery and manage any potential risks. Does that help clarify things a bit? [INST] Patient: It does.
