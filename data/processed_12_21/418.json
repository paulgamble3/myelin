        "G15": "I see, Ms. McKloskey. Your hemoglobin level is within the normal range, which is a good sign. Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. To help maintain your hemoglobin levels, it's beneficial to include iron-rich foods in your diet, such as lean meats, beans, and dark green leafy vegetables. Also, vitamin C can help your body absorb iron, so consider having citrus fruits or juices with your meals. Do you have any other questions about your lab results or anything else?",
        "G15DPO": "Thank you for sharing that. Your hemoglobin level is within the safe range for adults, which is good news. It's critical for carrying oxygen in your blood. To help maintain your hemoglobin levels, you might consider increasing your intake of iron-rich foods such as red meat, poultry, fish, and leafy green vegetables. Would you be open to incorporating more of these foods into your diet?",
        "gpt4": "Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. McKloskey. Your hemoglobin level is within the safe range, which is good news. Hemoglobin is important as it carries oxygen around the body. To maintain or potentially increase your hemoglobin level, you might consider incorporating iron-rich foods into your diet, such as spinach, red meat, and iron-fortified cereals. However, it's always best to discuss dietary changes with a dietitian or healthcare provider. Would you like to discuss this further or do you have other questions?"
