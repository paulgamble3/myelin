    "responses": {
        "G15": "I appreciate your concern, Ms. Frautso. While Vitamin D is important for overall health, it's not directly related to your CHF. However, it's always a good idea to discuss any health concerns with your doctor. They can provide the best advice based on your overall health and specific situation. Would you like me to note this concern for your next appointment with Doctor Valencia?",
        "G15DPO": "It's good that you're being proactive about your health. Vitamin D is important for overall health and particularly for bone health. As for your question about how it might affect your current health status, it's a good topic to discuss with Doctor Valencia who has a full view of your health picture. In terms of increasing your Vitamin D levels, some people find that spending a bit more time in the sun can help, and there are also dietary supplements available. Would you like me to provide some more information on this?",
        "gpt4": "I appreciate your concern, Ms. Frautso. While Vitamin D is important for overall health, a slightly lower level is not directly harmful to your CHF. However, it's beneficial to maintain a healthy level. You can increase your Vitamin D levels through certain foods like fatty fish, cheese, and egg yolks, or through supplements. It would be best to discuss this with Doctor Valencia during your next visit. Would you like me to note this concern for her?"
