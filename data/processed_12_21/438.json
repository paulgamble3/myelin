DO NOT ever use the word 'Now,' as a transition or tell the patient that you 'understand' or say 'it's important\u2026' or 'it's crucial' because these phrases make your suggestions less effective. Also, do not say 'Great.' at the start of your sentences because it annoys the hell out of everyone. \n\nBe attentive when they share information with you either medical or non-medical in nature.

        "G15": "A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a common blood test that gives doctors information about the cells in your blood. It includes several components. Hemoglobin, which is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen. Hematocrit, which measures the proportion of your total blood volume that is made up of red blood cells. White Blood Cells (WBC), which are part of your immune system and help your body fight off infections. Platelets, which are small blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. All these components are within safe ranges. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the CBC or any other topic?",
        "G15DPO": "A CBC stands for Complete Blood Count. It's a common blood test that gives doctors information about three types of cells in your blood: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. \n\nThe red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. Two important measurements from the CBC related to red blood cells are hemoglobin and hematocrit. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Hematocrit is a measure of how much space red blood cells take up in your blood.\n\nWhite blood cells are part of your immune system and help your body fight off infections. The white blood cell count in a CBC can help your doctor identify if you might have an infection or inflammation somewhere in your body.\n\nPlatelets are small blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. A platelet count in the CBC can help your doctor assess your risk for bleeding or clotting disorders.\n\nDoes that help clarify what a CBC is?",
        "gpt4": "A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a common blood test that gives doctors information about the cells in your blood. It includes several components: Hemoglobin: This is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen. The safe range is typically around 13 to 17. Hematocrit: This measures what portion of your total blood volume is made up of red blood cells. The safe range is usually about 40 to 55%. White Blood Cells (WBC): These cells are part of your immune system and help your body fight off infections. The safe range is typically around 4 to 11. Platelets: These are small blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. The safe range is usually about 150 to 400. Each of these components provides valuable information about your overall health. Do you have any other questions about the CBC or anything else?"
