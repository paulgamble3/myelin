        "G15": "TSH, or Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, is a hormone that controls thyroid function in your body. It's important to know your TSH level because it can affect your overall health and recovery after surgery. If your TSH level is outside the normal range, it could indicate a thyroid disorder that might need to be managed before or after your surgery. However, if you're not currently experiencing any symptoms related to thyroid function, it's less likely to be a concern. Would you like to discuss this further or move on to the next topic?",
        "G15DPO": "Your TSH, or Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, level is a measure of how well your thyroid is functioning. The thyroid plays a key role in your body's metabolism and can affect many bodily functions. In the context of your upcoming surgery, it's one of many markers your doctor uses to ensure your body is in the best possible condition for the procedure and recovery. Does that help clarify things?",
        "gpt4": "TSH, or Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, is a hormone that controls thyroid function in your body. It's critical to know your TSH level because it can affect various aspects of your health, including energy levels, weight, and mood. In the context of surgery, it's particularly important because both high and low levels can affect your body's response to anesthesia and its ability to heal post-surgery. The safe range for TSH is typically between 0.4 and 5. If you're ready, we can move on to discuss your medications. Is that okay with you?"
