[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Trisha Raynier? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Hello, Ms. Raynier. I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Raynier. How has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: It's been alright. Thanks. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that your day has been alright, Ms. Raynier. Have you been able to do anything enjoyable today? [INST] Patient: Not really. I mean, I'm kinda just sitting watching Netflix. [/INST] Nurse: Oh, that sounds like a relaxing way to spend the day. What show are you currently watching on Netflix, Ms. Raynier? [INST] Patient: Well, my friend wanted me to finally watch the queen's gambit. [/INST] Nurse: Ah, \"The Queen's Gambit\" is quite a popular show. How are you finding it so far, Ms. Raynier? Are you enjoying the storyline? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I didn't think it'd be that interesting because I don't really care about chess. But the storytelling aspect and all the details make it really good to watch. [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Raynier. It's always a pleasant surprise when a show exceeds our expectations, isn't it? I'm glad you're enjoying it. I can imagine you must be looking forward to getting a new knee. Do you have any plans for what you'd like to do once you've recovered from your procedure? [INST] Patient: Not yet. [/INST] Nurse: That's perfectly fine, Ms. Raynier. There's plenty of time to think about it. Perhaps once you've recovered, you might find some new activities to enjoy. How are you feeling about your upcoming procedure? [INST] Patient: Fine. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling fine about the procedure, Ms. Raynier. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, please feel free to ask. I'm here to help. Would you like to go over anything specific before we begin? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Now that you mentioned it, before I you know, when I was scheduling my appointment, my doctor also still asked me to get a CBC what exactly is that? [/INST] Nurse: A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a blood test that's often ordered before a surgery. It gives your healthcare team important information about the types and numbers of cells in your blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can help them assess your overall health, detect a wide range of disorders, and monitor your response to treatment. It's a routine part of preoperative testing. Does that help clarify things for you, Ms. Raynier? [INST] Patient: Yeah.

        "G15": "For a CBC, there are several components that are checked. For hemoglobin, a safe range is typically between 11.5 and 15.5. For hematocrit, it's usually between 36 and 48. For white blood cells, the safe range is typically between 4 and 11. Lastly, for platelets, the safe range is usually between 150 and 400. These ranges can vary slightly depending on the lab that analyzes the test. The goal is to ensure your body is in a good state to undergo surgery and recover well. Does that help, Ms. Raynier?",
        "G15DPO": "For a CBC, there are a few key numbers they're looking at. For hemoglobin, a safe range is around 11.5 to 15.5. This protein in your red blood cells carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. Hematocrit, another measure of your red blood cells, should be in the range of 36 to 48. \n\nWhite blood cells, or WBC, are part of your immune system. A safe range for them is about 4 to 11. \n\nLastly, platelets are small blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. A safe range for platelets is around 150 to 400.\n\nThese ranges help ensure your body is functioning well and can handle the surgery and recovery process. Does that give you a better idea of what they're looking for?",
        "gpt4": "In a CBC test, they're looking at several different components. For example, they'll look at your hemoglobin levels, which should ideally be between 11.5 and 15.5. Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. They'll also look at your hematocrit, which should be between 36 and 48%. Hematocrit is the proportion of your total blood volume that is made up of red blood cells. Your white blood cell count is another important component, and it should ideally be between 4 and 11. White blood cells are crucial for your immune system and help your body fight off infections. Lastly, they'll look at your platelet count, which should be between 150 and 400. Platelets are small blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. These ranges are considered normal, but it's important to remember that everyone is unique and what's normal for one person might not be normal for another. The results of your CBC will help your healthcare team ensure you're in the best possible health for your surgery. Does that answer your question, Ms. Raynier?"
