        "G15": "Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Cruz. A BNP level of 124 is a bit higher than the typical safe range. This could indicate that your heart is working harder than it should be. It's one of the reasons your doctor has prescribed new medications to help manage your CHF. Let's move on to those medications. Have you been able to pick up your new prescription for Captopril 12.5 mg oral tablets?",
        "G15DPO": "Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Cruz. Your BNP level of 124 is a bit higher than the ideal range. This could be a sign that your heart is working a bit harder than it should be, which is why your doctor has prescribed new medications and diet changes to help manage your CHF. Does that help clarify things a bit?",
        "gpt4": "Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Cruz. A BNP level of 124 is slightly above the typical range, which can be a sign that your heart is working a bit harder than usual. This is something that your doctor is likely monitoring closely. It's critical to continue with your prescribed treatment plan and medications to help manage your CHF. Speaking of medications, have you been able to pick up your new prescriptions yet? Let's start with the Captopril 12.5 mg oral tablet. Have you picked that up?"
