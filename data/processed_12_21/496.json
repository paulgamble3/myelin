[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Carla Arnold? [INST] Patient: Yes. It is. [/INST] Nurse: Hello, Ms. Arnold. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Jack Smith, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately? [INST] Patient: I'm well. Thank you for asking. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Arnold. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? [INST] Patient: I'm really looking forward to my trip. I'm going to New York this week. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds exciting, Ms. Arnold! What are some of the things you're planning to do in New York? [INST] Patient: I'm gonna go see the rocettes. [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful, Ms. Arnold! The Rockettes are a classic New York experience. Have you seen them perform before, or will this be your first time? [INST] Patient: I've only seen them perform on my TV. Like, that's a thing giving day parade. I've never seen them in person. [/INST] Nurse: Oh, that's fantastic, Ms. Arnold! Seeing the Rockettes perform live is going to be a whole new experience for you. I'm sure you're going to enjoy it. Before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, do you have any symptoms or health concerns you'd like to share? [INST] Patient: No. I don't think so. I just really wanna know my lab results.

That I should have something called a DBC what does that mean and what is a CBC? [/INST] Nurse: A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a blood test that measures different components of the blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It's often used to check for conditions like anemia, infection, and other diseases. It can provide a lot of information about your overall health. Would you like me to note down that you're interested in having a CBC done for your care team to review? [INST] Patient: Sure. I'm okay with that. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect, Ms. Arnold. I've made a note for your care team to review your interest in a CBC. If it's alright with you, I'd like to go over a few more topics to check on how you're doing. Can we proceed? [INST] Patient: In one second. I have a few more questions about my lab if that's okay. [/INST] Nurse: ",
