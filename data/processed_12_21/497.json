        "G15": "A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a blood test that gives doctors information about three types of cells in your blood: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. The test measures the amount of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The safe range for hemoglobin is typically between 11.5 and 15.5. Hematocrit, another measure of red blood cells, is usually between 36 and 48. White blood cells are part of your immune system and help your body fight infections. The safe range for white blood cells is typically between 4 and 11. Platelets are small blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. The safe range for platelets is usually between 150 and 400. Does that help clarify what's in a CBC test, Ms. Winner?",
        "G15DPO": "A CBC test stands for Complete Blood Count. It's a blood test that gives doctors information about three types of cells in your body: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The test measures several components including hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, and platelet count. These values help your doctor check any potential health issues, especially related to your blood and immune system. Does that help clarify things for you?",
        "gpt4": "A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a blood test that gives doctors information about three types of cells in your blood: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Hemoglobin, which is part of your red blood cells, carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. The safe range for hemoglobin is typically between 11.5 to 15.5. Hematocrit is the proportion of your blood that is made up of red blood cells. The safe range for hematocrit is usually between 36 to 48%. White blood cells, or WBC, help your body fight infections. The safe range for WBC is typically between 4 to 11. Platelets are small blood cells that help your body form clots to stop bleeding. The safe range for platelets is usually between 150 to 400. These ranges can vary slightly depending on the lab that analyzes the blood sample. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the CBC test?"
