The AFP test your daughter had is a prenatal test that checks the level of alpha-fetoprotein in the mother's blood. It's used to assess the likelihood of certain birth defects in a baby. The results are usually considered within a safe range. Is there anything else you'd like to know about this or any other topic? [INST] Patient: What do you mean the results are you [/INST] Nurse: I apologize if I wasn't clear, Mr. Jimenez. [INST] Patient: really considered within a safe range. [/INST] Nurse: I apologize if my previous statement was unclear, Mr. Jimenez.

If the levels fall within this range, it generally indicates that the baby is developing normally. However, it's always best for your daughter to discuss her specific results with her healthcare provider. Is there anything else you'd like to ask about?
