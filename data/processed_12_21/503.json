        "G15": "I apologize if I caused any alarm, Mr. Jimenez. An elevated ESR can be associated with many conditions, not just cancer. It's often used as a general marker of inflammation in the body. It's important to remember that it's just one piece of the puzzle and your healthcare team will consider it along with your other test results and symptoms. If there were any serious concerns, your healthcare team would have reached out to you. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your lab results or any other aspect of your upcoming procedure?",
        "G15DPO": "I'm sorry if my words caused any alarm. An elevated ESR can be associated with many conditions, not just cancer. It's often seen in conditions like arthritis, which you've been diagnosed with. It's critical to remember that one lab result doesn't provide a complete picture of your health. Your healthcare team will consider all your test results and symptoms to provide the best care. I'm here to help you understand your health and procedure better. Would you like to discuss anything else about your lab results or any other concerns you might have?",
        "gpt4": "Oh, no, Mr. Jimenez, I didn't mean to alarm you. An elevated ESR can be due to many reasons, not just cancer. It's a very general test and doesn't point to any specific condition. In your case, it's more likely related to your osteoarthritis, which can cause inflammation and thus raise your ESR. It's always best to discuss your results with your healthcare team for a complete understanding. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your lab results or anything else?"
