[/INST] Nurse: Of course, take your time. I'm here to help answer any questions you may have. [INST] Patient: Well, [/INST] Nurse: Of course. Take your time.

And I need to know what dot what other diet or dietary changes I need to make to preserve my kidney function. [/INST] Nurse: That's a great question. It's critical to maintain a balanced diet to support your kidney health. May I go over a few dietary recommendations for managing kidney health? [INST] Patient: Enter [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that last part. Could you please repeat what you said about your diet? [INST] Patient: I didn't say anything. [/INST] Nurse: My apologies for the confusion. You mentioned you're on a low salt, low carb diet. That's a great start. As for other dietary changes, it's important to maintain a balanced diet. This includes eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. However, it's always best to consult with a dietitian or your doctor for personalized advice. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics to check on how you're doing? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Great, thank you. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? [INST] Patient: Six. Yes. [/INST] Nurse: That's excellent. Could you please share with me what your last blood sugar reading at home was? [INST] Patient: One thirty two. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that.

[INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. One strategy is to ensure you're eating balanced meals. This includes a mix of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. It's also important to limit your intake of sugary drinks and high-sugar foods. Regular physical activity can also help lower your blood sugar levels. Do you think these are strategies you could incorporate into your daily routine? [INST] Patient: Yes. I think so. [/INST] Nurse: That's great to hear. Remember, it's always important to discuss any changes in your diet or exercise routine with your doctor. Now, let's talk about your blood pressure. When was the last time you took your blood pressure, and what was the result? [INST] Patient: I took it yesterday. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for that information. Could you please share what the reading was? [INST] Patient: Yeah. It was one twenty five over eighty. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. A blood pressure reading of 125 over 80 is within the normal range, which is good news. It's important to keep monitoring your blood pressure regularly. Would it be okay if I share some suggestions about managing blood pressure? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Some strategies to manage blood pressure include reducing your salt intake, maintaining a healthy weight, and incorporating regular physical activity into your routine. It's also important to limit alcohol and quit smoking if you do. Do you think these are strategies you could implement? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I can implement those, but I do smoke. [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your honesty. [INST] Patient: And I really don't wanna give that up right now. [/INST] Nurse: I understand that quitting smoking can be a challenging process. It's essential to remember that it's a step-by-step journey and it's okay to take it one day at a time. When you're ready, there are resources available to help you. Now, I noticed that you recently had some blood tests and urine labs done. Do you have any questions about those results? [INST] Patient: Yeah.

Does that help clarify things for you? [INST] Patient: Yes. And what about my create need? [/INST] Nurse: Creatinine is a waste product that's produced by your muscles. It's normally removed from your blood by your kidneys. When your kidneys aren't working properly, the level of creatinine in your blood can increase. Your creatinine level was 0.8 mg/dL, which is within the normal range. This suggests that your kidneys are functioning well at this time. Does that make sense? [INST] Patient: Well, that's good news. [/INST] Nurse: Yes, it is indeed good news. Now, let's move on to discuss your medications. You're currently taking Captopril 12.5 mg oral tablet with a dosage of 25 mg daily.

[/INST] Nurse: Now, let's discuss your Insulin Lantus 100 IU/mL prefilled pen.
