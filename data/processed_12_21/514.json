        "G15": "I see, Mr. Weeks. Albumin is a protein that's made by your liver. It helps keep fluid in your bloodstream so it doesn't leak into other tissues. If your albumin levels are high, it could be a sign that your body is retaining too much fluid, which can be a concern with CHF. However, medication changes are typically based on a variety of factors, not just one lab result. It's best to discuss this with your doctor. Would you like me to note this concern for your next appointment with Doctor Stapleton?",
        "G15DPO": "Your albumin levels can provide some information about your overall health, especially your nutritional status. If your levels are a bit lower than the ideal range, it might be something we keep an eye on, especially in relation to your diet and overall health. As for your medications, unless there are specific concerns related to your albumin levels, they should remain the same. Does that help clarify things for you?",
        "gpt4": "I see, Mr. Weeks. Albumin is a protein that's made by your liver. It helps keep fluid in your bloodstream so it doesn't leak into other tissues. It's also important for healing and tissue growth. The normal range for albumin is between 3.5 and 5.4. If your albumin levels are high, it could be due to dehydration, high protein diet, or other factors. It's best to discuss this with your doctor who can interpret your lab results in the context of your overall health and current medications. Would you like me to help you prepare some questions for your doctor about this?"
