Please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our conversation. I see on your chart that you're getting this colonoscopy due to unexplained abdominal pain. I acknowledge that it can be quite a process to go through this procedure. How are you feeling about it? [INST] Patient: I'm feeling good.

I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming colonoscopy. I will also call you again the day before your procedure to check in. Let's start with your current medication.

Do you have any questions about this low fiber diet? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent, Mr. Dang. I'm glad to hear that you're clear on the diet instructions.

It's a good source of energy and it's easy on the digestive system. Do you have a favorite pasta dish you're looking forward to having during this time? [INST] Patient: Alex Spaghetti. [/INST] Nurse: Ally's Spaghetti sounds delicious, Mr. Dang. It's a rare time when doctors want their patients to be eating low fiber comfort foods. Do you usually make it at home or do you have a favorite place where you get it from? [INST] Patient: To make it at home. [/INST] Nurse: That's wonderful, Mr. Dang. Homemade meals are often the best. Do you have a special recipe for Ally's Spaghetti that you follow, or do you like to experiment with different ingredients each time? [INST] Patient: No. But just put it in a pot and boil the water and make it. [/INST] Nurse: You will need to stop any supplements you take like Psyllium husk or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications such as Celebrex? \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK> The nurse should be informed that Celebrex is not an anti-diarrheal medication, but rather a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). </TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: ",
