        "G15": "Certainly, Ms. Stokes. When you get your blood work done, there are a few key categories to keep an eye on. Hemoglobin, which should be within a certain range, is important for carrying oxygen in your blood. Hematocrit, another measure of your red blood cells, should also be within a specific range. White blood cells, or WBC, are part of your immune system and their count can indicate if your body is fighting off an infection. Lastly, platelets are small cells that help your blood clot, and their count should also be within a certain range. Do you have any specific concerns about these categories?",
        "G15DPO": "Sure, I can provide some general guidance on that. For your blood work, there are a few key categories to keep an eye on. Hemoglobin and hematocrit are measures of your red blood cells, with a target range of around 11.5 to 15.5 and 36 to 48 respectively. White blood cells, or WBC, are part of your immune system, and a normal range is about 4 to 11. Lastly, platelets are involved in clotting, and a healthy range is around 150 to 400. Does that help answer your question?",
        "gpt4": "Of course, Ms. Stokes. When you get your blood work done, there are several key categories to pay attention to. These include your hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, and platelet count. Your hemoglobin should ideally be between 11.5 and 15.5, hematocrit should be between 36 and 48, white blood cell count should be between 4 and 11, and platelet count should be between 150 and 400. These ranges are considered normal, but please remember that individual results can vary and it's always best to discuss your specific results with your healthcare provider. Do you have any other questions about your blood work or anything else you'd like to discuss?"
