[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Paxton Winner? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Hello, Ms. Winner. I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Fantastic, Ms. Winner. I hope your day is going well so far. Can you share a bit about how it's been? [INST] Patient: It's okay. But to be honest, kinda hard to take my mind off the procedure. [/INST] Nurse: I can imagine that it's a bit challenging, Ms. Winner. It's completely normal to have the procedure on your mind. Is there anything in particular that's been occupying your thoughts about the procedure? [INST] Patient: I'm just worried something will go wrong. [/INST] Nurse: I can see why you might feel that way, Ms. Winner. It's natural to have concerns about a procedure like this. However, I want to reassure you that your surgeon, Doctor Cristina Stevens, is highly experienced. She has performed over 1000 total knee replacements and is known for her excellent work. Also, total knee replacements are one of the most reliable treatments in medicine, with a high success rate. Is there anything specific about the procedure that you're worried about? [INST] Patient: I guess I'm just worried that something will go wrong, and my knee will be worse than before. [/INST] Nurse: I hear your concerns, Ms. Winner. It's completely normal to worry about the outcome. However, total knee replacements have a 90-95% success rate, and they're still functioning well even after 10 to 15 years. This procedure is designed to improve your quality of life by reducing pain and improving mobility. With your new knee, you'll likely be able to do things that may have been difficult due to your osteoarthritis. Speaking of which, have you thought about what you'd like to do once your knee has healed? Any activities you're looking forward to? [INST] Patient: I guess I'm looking forward to walking my dog again. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal, Ms. Winner. Walking your dog will not only be a great way to enjoy your improved mobility, but it's also a fantastic way to stay active and healthy. What's your dog's name and what breed is it? [INST] Patient: His name is Wiggles, and he's a Scottish Carrier. [/INST] Nurse: Wiggles sounds like a delightful companion, Ms. Winner. Scottish Carriers are known for their energy and playfulness. I bet Wiggles is excited to have more walks with you once you've recovered. Now, how are you feeling overall about your procedure? [INST] Patient: I guess I'm feeling a little better now. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Winner. It's perfectly okay to have concerns, and I'm here to help address them. Before we move on, do you have any other questions or anything else you'd like to discuss about the procedure? [INST] Patient: No. That's okay. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Ms. Winner. Please remember that you can ask me questions at any time during our call. I'm here to help. Now, I'd like to ensure you have everything you need for your procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Perfect, Ms. Winner. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Does that work for you? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent, Ms. Winner. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yes. I actually have a quick question. [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Ms. Winner. Please feel free to ask your question. [INST] Patient: The last time that I was there, and I think it was the first floor, The doctor ordered for me to get something called a CMP for my blood. What exactly is that? [/INST] Nurse: A CMP, or Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, is a blood test that measures different components in your blood. It includes tests for things like glucose (sugar), electrolytes (like sodium and potassium), and kidney function. It also checks your liver function by measuring levels of various liver enzymes and proteins. For instance, albumin is a protein made by the liver, and its levels can tell us about your liver's health and your nutritional status. The safe range for albumin is typically between 3.5 to 5.4. Alkaline phosphatase and alanine transaminase are enzymes found in the liver and other tissues. Their levels can help assess liver health. The safe range for alkaline phosphatase is typically between 36 to 150, and for alanine transaminase, it's between 10 to 61. This test is a routine part of preoperative care to ensure your body is in the best possible condition for the procedure. Does that help clarify things a bit, Ms. Winner? [INST] Patient: Sure.

You might have heard of it in relation to jaundice, a condition that causes a yellowing of the skin and eyes. This is because high levels of bilirubin in the blood can lead to these symptoms. In the context of your CMP, the safe range for bilirubin is within the low end of the scale. This means your body is effectively processing and removing old red blood cells. Does that answer your question about bilirubin?",

The liver helps to break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool. A high level of bilirubin in the blood can lead to jaundice, which is a yellowing of the skin and eyes. In most cases, a low or normal level of bilirubin in the blood is a good sign that your liver is working properly."
