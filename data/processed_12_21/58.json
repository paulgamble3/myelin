        "G15": "I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Martin. You're correct. Valsartan and Lasix are not used to lower blood sugar. They are used to manage your CHF and edema. Valsartan helps to relax your blood vessels, which can lower your blood pressure and make it easier for your heart to pump. Lasix helps your body get rid of extra water and salt, which can also help with your CHF. Now, have you been able to pick up your new medications, Lasix and Valsartan, from the pharmacy?",
        "G15DPO": "I apologize for any confusion. To clarify, your medications, Valsartan and Lasix, are primarily used to manage your blood pressure and reduce edema or swelling, especially in your lungs and feet. They don't have a direct effect on your blood sugar levels. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your medications or our conversation today?",
        "gpt4": "I apologize for the confusion, Mr. Martin. Valsartan and Lasix are actually used to manage your CHF, not your blood sugar levels. Valsartan helps to relax your blood vessels and reduce fluid buildup, while Lasix helps your body get rid of extra water and salt. These medications are important for managing your condition. Have you been able to pick up your new medications, Lasix and Valsartan, from the pharmacy?"
