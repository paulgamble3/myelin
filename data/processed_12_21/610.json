        "G15": "Of course, Mr. Douglas. Sodium is an important electrolyte in your body. It helps maintain the balance of fluids in and around your cells. The safe range for sodium is typically between 135 and 145. If your sodium levels are within this range, it's a good sign that your body is maintaining a healthy balance. Do you have any specific questions about your sodium levels or how to manage them?",
        "G15DPO": "Sure, I'm happy to help clarify your lab results. Your safe range for sodium is between 135 and 145. Can you share what your recent sodium levels were?",
        "gpt4": "Of course, Mr. Douglas. Sodium is an important electrolyte in the body, and maintaining a balance is crucial. The safe range for sodium levels in the body is typically between 135 and 145. If your sodium levels are outside this range, it could indicate a problem. However, your doctor would be the best person to interpret your lab results and explain what they mean for your health. As for dietary recommendations, it's important to limit high-sodium foods such as processed meats, canned soups, and fast food. Instead, try to incorporate more fresh fruits and vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains into your diet. Also, try to limit your fluid intake to 1.5 liters per day to help manage your CHF. Does this information help answer your questions about sodium and your diet?"
