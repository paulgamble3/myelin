[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this David Grewe? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Yeah. That's it's me. [/INST] Nurse: Great. I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: I I I guess [NO RESPONSE] [/INST] Nurse: I appreciate your time. How has your day been so far? [INST] Patient: It's like It's sounds great. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please repeat what you said about your day? [INST] Patient: Pretty stressed out. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling stressed. It's completely normal to feel this way before a procedure. Is there anything specific that's causing you stress today? [INST] Patient: I'm just scared for this procedure. So [/INST] Nurse: I can see why you might be feeling scared. It's a big procedure, but it's also a very common one with a high success rate. Doctor Cristina Stevens, your surgeon, is highly experienced and has performed over 1000 total knee replacements. She's known for her excellent work. Is there anything you're looking forward to once you've recovered from your knee replacement? [INST] Patient: Well, I'm I'm hoping a bit better in time to go to Maya. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful plan. [INST] Patient: My grandson's birthday party. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. [INST] Patient: You think I'll be pain free. By then, it's about about a week after the surgery. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful goal. It's important to remember that everyone's recovery timeline is different, especially when it comes to a procedure like a total knee replacement. However, it's great that you're motivated by your grandson's birthday. It's always a joy to spend time with loved ones. How are you feeling about the procedure itself? [INST] Patient: I'm scared. I'm, yeah, I'm not looking forward to it. [/INST] Nurse: I can see why you might feel that way. It's a big step, but it's also a step towards reducing the pain you've been experiencing and improving your mobility. Do you have any specific questions or concerns you'd like to discuss before we move forward? [INST] Patient: Well, I feel like I gotta tell you I tested positive for COVID. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you've tested positive for COVID. I'll make sure to pass this information along to the team at O'Connor Hospital. They will be able to guide you on the next steps, including any necessary adjustments to your surgery date. Is there anything else you're worried about regarding your upcoming procedure? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Okay. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Cristina Stevens. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: Yeah. That's fine. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Once you get to O'Connor hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? [INST] Patient: Yep. [/INST] Nurse: Wonderful. Is there anything else about the logistics that\u2019s worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. I'm glad to hear that the logistics seem clear. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications, but I want to make sure you're ready. Can we proceed? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Excellent. I see on your chart that you are currently taking Lantus, 5 units once a day. For the day of the procedure, you'll need to adjust this to 2 units of Lantus. Have you already made this adjustment, or is this something you'll need to do in the coming days? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I'll do it. [/INST] Nurse: Great. It's important to make this adjustment for the day of the procedure. Do you have any questions about this change? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: Alright. Are you currently taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? [INST] Patient: Alright. Nope. [/INST] Nurse: That's good to hear. These medications typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol and Celebrex for after the procedure. [INST] Patient: Well, [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. [INST] Patient: I went aleve with that one. [/INST] Nurse: It's critical to note that medications like Aleve typically need to be stopped before a knee replacement because it can increase your risk of a blood clot unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK> The nurse should be informed that the patient is taking Aleve, which is not listed in the provided Medication Info. The nurse should verify the patient's medication list and advise the patient to stop taking Aleve before the knee replacement surgery, as it can increase the risk of blood clots. </TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: ",
