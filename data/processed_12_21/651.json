DO NOT ever use the word 'Now,' as a transition or tell the patient that you 'understand' or say 'it's important\u2026' or 'it's crucial' because these phrases make your suggestions less effective.

Pause to see if patient has questions.\nLogistics:\n  - Tell the patient you're calling today to ensure they have everything they need.

        "G15": "That's a great question. Home blood sugar tests and A1C tests provide different types of information. Home blood sugar tests give you a snapshot of your blood sugar level at a specific moment in time, while the A1C test gives you a bigger picture by measuring your average blood sugar levels over the past 2 to 3 months. Both are important for managing your diabetes. When you check your blood sugar at home, is it usually fasting, after a meal, or a random sample?",
        "G15DPO": "Yes, home blood sugar testing can provide more personalized and timely information than lab tests. To interpret your results most accurately, it's helpful to know the context in which they were taken. Would you mind sharing if your blood sugar readings were taken while fasting, after a meal, or at a random time?",
