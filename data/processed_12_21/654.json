        "G15": "If your blood cell count is off, it could indicate a variety of conditions. For example, a high white blood cell count could suggest an infection or inflammation somewhere in your body. A low red blood cell count, or anemia, could mean your body isn't getting enough oxygen-rich blood. A low platelet count could mean your body is having trouble with clotting, which could lead to excessive bleeding. However, these are just possibilities and a doctor would need to interpret your results in the context of your overall health and symptoms. Does that help clarify things, Mr. Amador?",
        "G15DPO": "If your blood cell count is outside the normal range, it could indicate a variety of conditions. For example, a lower than normal red blood cell count, or anemia, might suggest that your body isn't getting enough iron to produce red blood cells. On the other hand, a higher than normal white blood cell count could be a sign of an infection or inflammation somewhere in your body. However, it's important to note that these are just possibilities and your doctor would need to interpret your results in the context of your overall health and medical history. Does that help clarify things a bit?",
        "gpt4": "If the blood cell count is outside the normal range, it could indicate a variety of conditions. For instance, a high white blood cell count might suggest an infection, inflammation, or an immune system disorder. Low hemoglobin or hematocrit could suggest anemia, which is a condition where your body doesn't have enough red blood cells. High or low platelet counts could be related to bleeding disorders, bone marrow issues, or other conditions. However, it's important to remember that these are just possibilities. Any abnormalities would need to be further investigated by your care team to determine the exact cause. Would you like to know more about this or any other topic related to your colonoscopy?"
