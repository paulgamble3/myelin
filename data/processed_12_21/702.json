It's something your healthcare team will likely keep an eye on. Have you noticed any symptoms like thirst, swelling, or frequent urination?",
        "G15DPO": "Sure, I can help clarify that for you. Your recent lab results show your sodium level at 147. This is slightly above the typical range we like to see, which is between 135 and 145. Sodium levels help to regulate the amount of water that's in and around your cells. When they're a bit higher than normal, it can sometimes make you feel more thirsty or cause you to urinate more often. Does that help explain things a bit better?",

They may suggest dietary changes or other interventions if necessary. Does that help clarify things a bit?"
