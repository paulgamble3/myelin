        "G15": "I see, Ms. Fernandez. High potassium levels can sometimes be a concern, especially when it comes to certain medications. However, it's best to discuss this with your care team who can provide the most accurate advice based on your overall health and specific circumstances. I will note this down for them to review. Now, let's move on to the next topic. Are you following any specific diet in preparation for your colonoscopy?",
        "G15DPO": "Thank you for confirming that. I will make a note of your high potassium levels for your care team to review. In terms of your medication, Plavix 75 mg is commonly used to prevent blood clots. It's possible that your doctor may adjust your medication or diet to help manage your potassium levels. Would you be open to any dietary changes if recommended by your doctor?",
        "gpt4": "I see, Ms. Fernandez. High potassium levels can sometimes be a concern, but it's important to remember that the safe range for potassium is between 3.5 and 5.0. If your levels are slightly above this, it doesn't necessarily mean you need to change your medication. However, I will note this down for your care team to review. They will be able to provide the most accurate advice based on your overall health and specific circumstances. In the meantime, it might be helpful to be mindful of your diet, as certain foods are high in potassium. These include bananas, oranges, and potatoes. Do you typically consume a lot of these foods?"
