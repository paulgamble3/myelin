        "G15": "A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a blood test that gives doctors information about three types of cells in your blood: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help doctors check any symptoms, such as weakness, fatigue, or bruising, you may have. It can also help diagnose conditions such as anemia, infections, and many other disorders. The test measures several components and ratios, including:\n\n- Hemoglobin: This is the oxygen-carrying protein in your red blood cells.\n- Hematocrit: This measures the proportion of your total blood volume that is made up of red blood cells.\n- Red blood cell count: This is the number of red blood cells in a given volume of blood.\n- White blood cell count: This is the number of white blood cells in a given volume of blood.\n- Platelet count: This is the number of platelets in a given volume of blood.\n\nEach of these components can provide valuable information about your overall health. For example, a low red blood cell count could indicate anemia, while a high white blood cell count could indicate an infection or inflammation somewhere in your body.\n\nDoes that help clarify what a CBC is and what it tests for?",

This test can help your doctor check any symptoms you might have, such as weakness, fatigue, or bruising, and can help diagnose conditions such as anemia, infections, and many other disorders. The specific tests within a CBC include: Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, Red cell count, White blood cell count, Platelet count, and Differential count (which looks at the different types of white blood cells).

It measures several components of your blood, including: Red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout your body. White blood cells, which fight infections. Hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Hematocrit, the proportion of your total blood volume that is made up of red blood cells. Platelets, which help with clotting. This test can help your doctor check for any potential issues such as anemia, infection, and other disorders. Is there anything else you'd like to know about the CBC or can we move on to discussing your knee replacement?"
