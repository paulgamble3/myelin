[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Yu Zhong? [INST] Patient: Yes. It is. [/INST] Nurse: Hello, Mr. Zhong. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Maria Rodriguez. I hope you're feeling better after your recent hospital stay. How are you doing today? [INST] Patient: Doing pretty well. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Zhong. Being back home must be a relief. Is there anything in particular you've been looking forward to doing now that you're home?

It's a test that measures the amount of urea nitrogen in your blood. Urea nitrogen is a waste product that's created in your liver when the body breaks down proteins. Normally, the kidneys filter out this waste, and it leaves the body through urine.

It does. \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>The safe range for blood urea nitrogen is 7 to 25 mg/dL.\nDon't specify unit unless patient asks for it.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: ",
