I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Marta Marcuso, to check in on you. How have you been feeling lately? [INST] Patient: Oh, I'm hoping I'm okay. How are you, Rachel?

[/INST] Nurse: That sounds lovely, Mr. Benton. Dogs are such wonderful companions. What's your dog's name and what breed is he or she? [INST] Patient: His name is doctor, and I don't know what brief he is. Some kind of carrier mix, gremlin. [/INST] Nurse: Doctor sounds like a delightful companion, Mr. Benton.

[/INST] Nurse: Of course, Mr. Benton. [INST] Patient: Because I got [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Mr. Benton. I'm here to help. [INST] Patient: a CDC test, but can you tell me what what that actually is, what that means, [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Mr. Benton. A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a blood test that gives information about the cells in your blood. It measures three types of blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It can help your doctor check any symptoms like weakness, fatigue, or bruising you may have. It can also help diagnose conditions like anemia, infections, and many other disorders. Do you have any specific questions about your CBC results? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I do. In my CBC result Patient: I had A white blood cell? Count of three, and I just wanted to double check that's good, isn't it? [/INST] Nurse: A white blood cell count of 3 is on the lower end of the normal range. White blood cells are part of the body's immune system and help fight infections. The normal range can vary slightly depending on the lab, but it's generally between 4.5 and 11.0 x 10^9 cells per liter. A count of 3 might indicate a slightly weakened immune system. However, this can be influenced by many factors, including stress, diet, or even the time of day the test was taken. It's best to discuss this with Doctor Marcuso during your next appointment. Would you like to discuss anything else about your labs, or can we move on to some other topics related to your health? [INST] Patient: Yeah. I also have a result called PCV.
