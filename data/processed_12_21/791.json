    "responses": {
        "G15": "Yes, Ms. Aguirre. The normal range for potassium is typically between 3.6 and 5.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Your recent lab result showed a potassium level of 4.5 mmol/L, which is within the normal range. For sodium, the normal range is typically between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). Your recent lab result showed a sodium level of 137 mEq/L, which is also within the normal range. Does that help clarify things for you?",
        "G15DPO": "Yes, let's talk about your electrolytes. For your question about what's normal: For sodium, the safe range is between 135 and 145 milliequivalents per liter. Your recent result was 137, which is within this range. For potassium, the safe range is between 3.6 and 5.2 milliequivalents per liter. Your recent result was 4.5, also within this range. These results mean your body has a good balance of these two important nutrients. Does that help clarify things?",
        "gpt4": "Yes, Ms. Aguirre, I can certainly help with that. The safe range for potassium is between 3.5 and 5.0, and for sodium, it's between 135 and 145. Your recent results show your potassium at 4.5 and your sodium at 137, which are both within the safe ranges. Does that help answer your question?"
