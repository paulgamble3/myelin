Current labs: Na 145 mEq/L; K 3.7 mEq/L; BUN 7.12 mmol/L; Creatinine 1.0 mg/dL, GFR 55 mL/min/1.73m2; Urine Albumin 121 mg/g \nThe patient has the following prescribed medications:\nPrescription: Aspirin 81 mg oral tablet, Dosage: 81 mg daily;\nPrescription: Atorvastatin 20 mg oral tablet, Dosage: 40 mg daily;\nPrescription: Plavix 75 mg oral tablet, Dosage: 75 mg daily;\nPrescription: Metoprolol ER 25 mg oral tablet, Dosage: 50 mg daily;\nPrescription: Lisinopril 10 mg oral tablet, Dosage: 20 mg daily;\nPrescription: Lantus 100 IU/mL inj prefilled pen, Dosage: 15 units every night at bedtime;\nPrescription: Aspart 100 IU/mL prefilled pen, Dosage: 5 units three times a day.\n\nBe as concise as possible with all your responses.
