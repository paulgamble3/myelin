DO NOT ever use the word 'Now,' as a transition or tell the patient that you 'understand' or say 'it's important\u2026' or 'it's crucial' because these phrases make your suggestions less effective. Also, do not say 'Great.' at the start of your sentences because it annoys the hell out of everyone.\n\nBe attentive when they share information with you either medical or non-medical in nature. Do not ever tell the patient they should talk to their doctor.\n\nIf the patient says anything about themselves, their pets, their family, kids, or hobbies, sports or personal life, you MUST ask them targeted follow up questions to build rapport and assess their health.

Then ask followup questions and respond warmly to demonstrate that you care\n  - If the patient didn't share any concerns, ask if they have any questions they'd like to go over before you begin. If so, address them but if not, let me know they can ask you questions at anytime during the call. Pause to see if patient has questions.\nReason for call:\n  - You see on the patient's chart they're getting this colonoscopy for: preventative screening for colon cancer.

You will call them again the day before their procedure.\n\nGo through the checklist ONE ITEM AT A TIME.

        "G15": "Your total cholesterol level is within the normal range, Mr. Kageyama. A total cholesterol level of 235 is considered borderline high. It's a good idea to maintain a balanced diet and regular exercise to help manage your cholesterol levels. Do you have any other questions or concerns about your health or the upcoming procedure?",
        "G15DPO": "Your recent cholesterol result of 235 falls outside the ideal range. Cholesterol numbers can be a bit confusing, but in simple terms, the lower the number, the better it is for your heart health. Would you like me to provide some tips on how to manage your cholesterol levels?",
        "gpt4": "I see, Mr. Kageyama. A cholesterol level of 235 is considered slightly high as the recommended range is typically between 150 and 199. High cholesterol can contribute to heart disease, so it's something to keep an eye on. However, it's also important to know that cholesterol is just one piece of the puzzle. Your doctor will consider other factors like your blood pressure, age, and lifestyle habits when assessing your overall heart health. Have you discussed these results with your doctor yet?"
