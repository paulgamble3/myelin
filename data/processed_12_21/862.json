I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Jeff Crane. I hope you're feeling a bit more comfortable now that you're back home from the hospital. How are you doing today? [INST] Patient: Yeah. Home? Patient: Doing a little better. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Cruz. Being at home can often be a comfort.

[/INST] Nurse: That sounds lovely, Ms. Cruz. Preparing for Christmas can be such a joyful time. Are there any special traditions you enjoy during this season? [INST] Patient: Well, I'd like to decorate cookies with my grandkids. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful tradition, Ms. Cruz. I bet your grandkids love spending that time with you. Do you have a favorite type of cookie to decorate? Before we continue, I'd like to mention that I have a few topics to cover with you today on behalf of Doctor Crane. Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address before we get started on this list? [INST] Patient: That was a weird thing you just said there. Anyway, Yeah. I do have a question. [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Ms. Cruz. I'm here to help. What's your question? [INST] Patient: Well, I looked over my lab results from my hospital visit because, you know, you can see everything on the portal. And they ordered two tests, so I don't know why they ordered them. They're called and my lace \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>You may have misheard the patient. Ask them to repeat themselves</TASK><</SYS>>\nPatient: and lipase. [/INST] Nurse: I see, Ms. Cruz. Amylase and Lipase are enzymes that your body produces. They're often tested to check the health of your pancreas. Amylase helps your body break down and digest carbohydrates while Lipase helps with the digestion of fats. The safe range for Amylase is typically between 6.5 and 48.1, and for Lipase, it's usually 0 to 95. Do you recall what your results were? [INST] Patient: Well, my results weren't abnormal, but I want wondering why they ordered that on me. Do I have a problem with my pancreas? [/INST] Nurse: I see where you're coming from, Ms. Cruz. It's natural to wonder about these things. However, these tests are often part of a routine set of labs to ensure everything is functioning as it should. If your results were within the normal range, it's a good sign that your pancreas is functioning well. But, if you have any specific concerns about your pancreas or digestive health, it would be best to discuss them with Doctor Crane during your next appointment.
