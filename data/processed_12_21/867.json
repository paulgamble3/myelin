I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Maria Suarez, to check in on you. How have you been feeling lately? [INST] Patient: A bit scared. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling scared, Ms. Rivers. Can you share more about what's been causing you to feel this way? [INST] Patient: Yeah.

Hemoglobin is the part of your red blood cells that carries oxygen, and hematocrit is the ratio of the volume of red cells to the volume of whole blood. If these levels are lower than normal, it could indicate anemia. However, only a healthcare professional can diagnose anemia. If you're feeling symptoms like fatigue, weakness, or shortness of breath, it might be a good idea to discuss this with your healthcare team. Would you like me to note this concern for Doctor Suarez's team? [INST] Patient: Yes, please. But also, how do I know the levels are lower than normal. [/INST] Nurse: ",

However, these ranges can vary slightly depending on the lab that analyzes the blood test. It's always best to discuss your results with your healthcare team.
