        "G15": "I see, Ms. Steele. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. While it's normal to have some, having levels that are slightly above the normal range isn't usually a cause for immediate concern. However, it's something to keep an eye on. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains can help manage triglyceride levels. Regular physical activity can also help. Do you have any specific concerns about your triglyceride levels?",
        "G15DPO": "Your concern about your health is commendable. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. When they're slightly above the normal range, it's often related to diet. Given your healthy eating habits, it might be worth discussing this with your healthcare team. They can provide more personalized advice based on your overall health and lifestyle. Would you like me to note this concern for your upcoming appointment?",
        "gpt4": "I see, Ms. Steele. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in your blood. While it's ideal to have them within the normal range, a slight elevation isn't usually a cause for immediate concern. It's often recommended to maintain a healthy diet and regular exercise, which you're already doing with your oatmeal breakfasts and walks. However, it's always a good idea to discuss these results with your healthcare provider for personalized advice. Does that help answer your question?"
