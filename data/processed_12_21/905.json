The safe range for hematocrit is 36 to 48 %.\nDon't specify unit unless patient asks for it.</TASK><</SYS>>\n[/INST] Nurse: Anemia is typically diagnosed through a blood test that measures the amount of hemoglobin and hematocrit in your blood. Hemoglobin is the protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen, and hematocrit is the proportion of your blood that is made up of red blood cells. If these levels are lower than the safe range, it could indicate anemia. However, only a healthcare professional can diagnose anemia. If you suspect you might have anemia, it would be best to discuss this with your healthcare team. They can arrange for the appropriate tests and guide you on the next steps. Is there anything else you'd like to know about anemia or any other concerns you have? [INST] Patient: No. I think that's it. Thank you, Rachel. [/INST] Nurse: ",
