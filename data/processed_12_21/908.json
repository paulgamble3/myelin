[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Cortez Wiggins? [INST] Patient: Yes. [/INST] Nurse: Hello, Mr. Wiggins. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Maria Smith, to check in on you. How have you been doing lately? [INST] Patient: I've been doing alright. Thanks. [/INST] Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Wiggins. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? [INST] Patient: Oh, I don't know about looking forward to, but I'm helping my son out with his history projects. For some reason, he has decided to do potatoes. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds interesting, Mr. Wiggins. History projects can be quite enlightening. What specific aspect of potatoes is your son focusing on? Is it their origin, their impact on certain societies, or something else? [INST] Patient: He wanted to do the topic of how they created the potato chip. [/INST] Nurse: That's a unique and fun topic, Mr. Wiggins! It's fascinating how something as simple as a potato chip has such a rich history. How are you assisting him in his project? Are you helping with research or perhaps with creating a presentation? [INST] Patient: Well, I want him to learn how to do his own research. So for now, I'm just double checking his sources and helping him kind of make the poster board look nice. [/INST] Nurse: That's a wonderful approach, Mr. Wiggins. Guiding him while allowing him to take the lead in his project is a great way to foster independence and critical thinking. I'm sure the poster board will turn out great with your help. Before we move on to discuss your kidney disease, I wanted to ask if there are any symptoms or health concerns you've been experiencing lately that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: No. I don't think so. [/INST] Nurse: Alright, Mr. Wiggins. If you have any questions or concerns at any point during our conversation, feel free to bring them up. I'm here to help. Would it be alright if we go over a few topics related to your health now? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Wiggins. Since you have Type II Diabetes, it's important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly. Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? If so, could you share your last reading with me? [INST] Patient: One twenty eight. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Wiggins. Was your blood sugar reading of 128 taken while fasting, after a meal, or was it a random sample? [INST] Patient: It was in the morning before I had breakfast. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you for that information, Mr. Wiggins. A fasting blood sugar level from 100 to 125 mg/dL is considered prediabetes. So, your reading is a bit higher than the normal range. Would you be open to discussing some strategies to help manage your blood sugar levels? [INST] Patient: Well, I am a diabetic.
