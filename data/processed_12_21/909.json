        "G15": "A hematocrit level of 20% is also lower than the typical range. Both hemoglobin and hematocrit are measures of the amount of red blood cells in your body. Red blood cells carry oxygen to your tissues. When these levels are lower, it can mean your body isn't getting as much oxygen as it needs. This can sometimes lead to symptoms like fatigue or shortness of breath. However, since you're not experiencing these symptoms, it's a good sign. It's something we'll keep an eye on. Would you like to discuss any other health concerns or questions you have?",
        "G15DPO": "Thank you for sharing that. Your hematocrit is also on the lower end of the typical range. Similar to your hemoglobin, this could be related to your chronic kidney disease. Would it be okay if we go over a few topics to check on how you're doing in relation to your overall health?",
        "gpt4": "A hematocrit level of 20% is also lower than the typical range, Ms. Arnold. Similar to hemoglobin, low hematocrit can be associated with fatigue and shortness of breath. However, since you're not experiencing these symptoms, it's a good sign. I'll make a note of these lab results for your care team to review. Would it be okay if we go over a few more topics related to your health?"
