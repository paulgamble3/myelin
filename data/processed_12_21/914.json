        "G15": "That's a good question, Ms. Galanais. The thyroid gland plays a crucial role in the body's metabolism, which can affect many body functions, including heart function. Testing your thyroid can provide valuable information about your overall health and how your body is responding to treatment. It can also help identify any potential issues that might be contributing to your CHF symptoms. Does that help clarify things a bit?",
        "G15DPO": "That's a great question. Your doctors are testing your thyroid because the thyroid hormones can affect your overall health and how your body responds to other treatments, especially for your CHF. They want to ensure that your thyroid is functioning well and not contributing to any additional stress on your heart. Does that help clarify things a bit?",
        "gpt4": "That's a good question, Ms. Galanais. The thyroid gland, which is in your neck, produces hormones that have a big impact on your metabolism and energy levels. These hormones can also affect your heart rate and blood pressure. So, even though it might not seem directly related to your CHF, it's important to make sure your thyroid is functioning properly. The tests are looking at levels of two hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine. The safe range for thyroxine is between 64 and 154, and for triiodothyronine, it's between 1.1 and 2.9. I hope that helps clarify things a bit. Is there anything else you're curious about?"
