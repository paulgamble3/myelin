[/INST] Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from O'Connor Hospital. I'm an AI on a recorded line. Is this Daniel Jimenez? [INST] Patient: Yeah. [/INST] Nurse: Hello, Mr. Jimenez. I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement. Is this a good time to talk? [INST] Patient: Sure. [/INST] Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Jimenez. I hope your day is going well. Can you share a bit about how your day has been so far? [INST] Patient: Oh, sure. I just try to get the place cleaned up. Before. Go for surgery. [/INST] Nurse: It sounds like you're being proactive and getting your home ready before your surgery. That's a smart move. How are you managing with your current knee condition while doing these tasks? [INST] Patient: Well, it's painful. But I'm hoping I'm gonna be better pretty soon. [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry to hear about the pain, Mr. Jimenez. It's admirable how you're managing it. With your upcoming knee replacement, you'll be on the path to relief. Have you thought about what you're looking forward to doing once your new knee is in place and you've recovered? [INST] Patient: I'm doing dancing. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds exciting, Mr. Jimenez! Dancing is a wonderful way to stay active and enjoy yourself. Do you have a particular style of dance you enjoy or are you planning to try something new once you've recovered? [INST] Patient: Oh, I go to this blues jam on Sundays. And I haven't been able to dance. So I'm looking forward to getting back to dancing there. [/INST] Nurse: That sounds like a fantastic plan, Mr. Jimenez! Blues dancing must be a lot of fun. It's a great way to express yourself and stay active. I bet the community at the jam has been missing you. Switching gears a bit, how are you feeling about your upcoming procedure? [INST] Patient: Well, like I said, I mentioned just to get it done so I can get back to things. Hey, do I need to have any blood tests before I have the procedure. [/INST] Nurse: I can see how eager you are to get back to your activities, Mr. Jimenez. As for your question, typically, preoperative tests such as blood tests are part of the process to ensure you're in the best possible health for the procedure. However, the specifics would have been discussed with you during your preoperative consultation. If you're unsure, I recommend reaching out to Doctor Stevens' office for clarification. Now, before we move on, do you have any other questions or concerns about the procedure that you'd like to discuss? [INST] Patient: Well, my friend had a knee replacement. And he said that before that, he had to have some tests to see how his blood was clotting. And my doctor didn't say anything about that. [/INST] Nurse: I see, Mr. Jimenez. It's natural to compare experiences with others who've had similar procedures. However, each patient's preoperative process can vary based on their individual health status and the surgeon's protocol. Tests like Prothrombin Time, Partial Thromboplastin Time, INR, and Thrombin Time are sometimes done to assess blood clotting. The safe ranges for these tests are as follows: Prothrombin Time is between 11 to 13 seconds, Partial Thromboplastin Time is between 25 to 35 seconds, INR is between 0.8 to 1.1, and Thrombin Time is between 18.5 to 24 seconds. If you haven't been informed about these tests, it could be that Doctor Stevens didn't deem them necessary for your case. However, if you're still concerned, it would be best to reach out to Doctor Stevens' office for more information. Now, if there are no more questions about the procedure, I'd like to review a few topics with you to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming surgery. Is that okay with you? [INST] Patient: What? Patient: Be calling me the ranges for the test. I'm just asking. If I need to have these check. Patient: Why didn't my doctor order them? \n[INST] <<SYS>> <TASK>The safe range for prothrombin time is 11 to 13 seconds.. The safe range for partial thromboplastin time is 25 to 35 seconds..
