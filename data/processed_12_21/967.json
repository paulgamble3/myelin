[INST] Patient: I do have a question for you. [/INST] Nurse: Of course, Ms. Grimes. Please feel free to ask your question. I'm here to help. [INST] Patient: [NO RESPONSE] Why do I need to know my age level? [/INST] Nurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Grimes, could you please repeat your question? I want to make sure I understand it correctly.

Knowing your T4 level is important because it helps your doctor understand how your thyroid is functioning.

However, it's not directly related to your colonoscopy. Would you like me to note down your question for your care team to review? [INST] Patient: No. [/INST] Nurse: ",
