DO NOT ever use the word 'Now,' as a transition or tell the patient that you 'understand' or say 'it's important\u2026' or 'it's crucial' because these phrases make your suggestions less effective.

        "G15": "A CBC, or Complete Blood Count, is a common blood test that gives doctors information about the cells in your blood. It includes several components: Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, White Blood Cells (WBC), and Platelets. Hemoglobin and Hematocrit are measures of the oxygen-carrying capacity of your blood. White Blood Cells are part of your immune system and help your body fight off infections. Platelets are small cells that help your blood clot. The safe ranges for these components are Hemoglobin: 13 to 17, Hematocrit: 40 to 55, WBC: 4 to 11, and Platelets: 150 to 400. The test results will help your doctor assess your overall health and detect any potential issues. Do you have any other questions about the CBC or anything else related to your health?",
