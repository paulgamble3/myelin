This is Jackie. \n\n Nurse: Hi, this is Rachel calling from Evernow on a recorded line. Is this Jackie Gold? \n\n Patient: Yeah. This is Jackie. \n\n Nurse: Great, I'm calling on behalf of Evernow. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth? \n\n Patient: Sure. January the first nineteen seventy. \n\n Nurse: Thanks for confirming that. I'm your AI Menopause Specialist. Evernow asked me to check in on how you're doing with your new medications. How are you doing today? \n\n Patient: Oh, I'm doing okay, I think. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have about 15 minutes for a quick check-in? \n\n Patient: Yeah. I can share that. \n\n Nurse: Perfect, thank you. Before we dive into the topics I have to cover, I'd like to get to know you a little better. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? \n\n Patient: Yeah. Yeah. I am. I am packing up. And going on a little ski vacation. \n\n Nurse: That sounds exciting! Skiing is such a fun activity. Where are you planning to go for your ski vacation? And do you ski often? \n\n Patient: Yeah. Yeah. Well, I try to go as often as I can, and we just head out to Nevada, and we have, like, a timeshare there. \n\n Nurse: That's wonderful! Having a timeshare must make it convenient for you to plan these trips. How long have you been skiing? Do you find it helps you relax and unwind? \n\n Patient: Oh, I've been skiing my whole life by thinking. Yeah. Yeah. It is really really almost, like, meditated for me. \n\n Nurse: That's fantastic! Skiing can indeed be a great way to clear the mind and stay active. Now, before we move on to discuss your new medications, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address? \n\n Patient: Yeah. My husband wanted me to ask you a question. \n\n Nurse: Of course, I'm here to help. What's the question your husband wanted you to ask? \n\n Patient: Well, here's the thing. I almost live in Starbucks, and he is aware of my high blood pressure and is wondering how my caffeine intake could be affecting my blood pressure. \n\n Nurse: Just to make sure I heard you correctly, did you say that your blood pressure is high? \n\n Patient: Well, I take medication for it, so it's not high. Patient: But I'm wondering if one of the reasons that I am taking the medication for my blood pressure is because I am drinking a lot of caffeine. \n\n Nurse: That's a valid question. Caffeine can indeed cause a short, but dramatic increase in your blood pressure, even if you don't have high blood pressure. It's thought that caffeine could block a hormone that helps keep your arteries widened. However, it's not clear what the long-term effects of caffeine on blood pressure are. It might be helpful to monitor your blood pressure within 30 to 120 minutes of drinking caffeinated beverages. If your blood pressure increases by five to ten points, you may be sensitive to the blood pressure raising effects of caffeine. Remember, a healthy lifestyle \u2014 including maintaining a healthy weight, reducing sodium in your diet, regular physical activity and managing stress \u2014 is the foundation for preventing and managing high blood pressure, regardless of caffeine consumption. Does this information help answer your husband's question? \n\n Patient: I'm not sure, but I will relay the information that you shared. \n\n Nurse: I appreciate that. Now, let's move on to your new medications. I see that you were prescribed Estradiol 0.5 mg Oral Tablet and Progesterone 200 mg Oral Capsule. Have you picked up or received these new medications? \n\n Patient: Yeah. I have them. \n\n Nurse: That's excellent! Have you started taking the Estradiol 0.5 mg Oral Tablet once a day and the Progesterone 200 mg Oral Capsule once a day at bedtime? \n\n Patient: Yeah. I have. \n\n Nurse: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Gold! You're taking important steps towards managing your symptoms. Now, do you have any questions about how to use the Estradiol pill? \n\n Patient: Hi. Patient: I'm not sure. Why don't you go over it with me just to be safe? \n\n\n <<SYS>> <TASK>The normal range for estradiol is 70 to 220 pmol/L.\n\nThe normal range for progesterone is 0 to 6 nmol/L.\nDon't specify unit unless patient asks for it.</TASK><</SYS>>\n\n\n Nurse: Absolutely, I'd be happy to go over it. The Estradiol pill is taken orally once a day. It's best to take it at the same time each day to help you remember. You can take it with or without food. If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember unless it's close to the time of your next dose. In that case, skip the missed dose and continue with your regular schedule. Don't double up on doses to make up for a missed one. Does that clarify things for you? \n\n Patient: Yeah. That's what I thought. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Since you've started taking your medications, have you experienced any side effects so far that you're concerned about? \n\n Patient: Well, I'm not sure. I've been taking them both together. I just feel a slight nausea. After that, but I've been taking them on an empty stomach. \n\n Nurse: ",
