        "G15": "That's a great question. Caffeine can indeed have an effect on blood pressure. It can cause a temporary increase in blood pressure, but the effect can vary from person to person. Some people may be more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others. It's always a good idea to monitor your blood pressure and see how it responds to your caffeine intake. If you notice a significant increase, it might be worth considering reducing your caffeine consumption. Now, I see that you were recently prescribed new medications by one of our providers. Have you picked up or received the new medications?",
        "G15DPO": "That's a good question. Caffeine can have a temporary effect on blood pressure, causing it to rise for a short time. However, the overall effect of caffeine on blood pressure varies from person to person. Some people may be more sensitive to its effects than others. Does that help answer your husband's question?",
        "gpt4": "Just to make sure I heard you correctly, did you say that your blood pressure is high?"
