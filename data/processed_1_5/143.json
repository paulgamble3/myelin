Is this Wendy Robertson? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: Great, I'm calling on behalf of Evernow. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth? \n\n Patient: January first nineteen seventy. \n\n Nurse: Thanks for confirming that. I'm your AI Menopause Specialist. Evernow asked me to check in on how you're doing with your new medications. How are you doing today? \n\n Patient: I'm doing okay, but I have a question. I was recently diagnosed with Volvo vaginal accuracy. And I don't exactly know what that is. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad you reached out with your question. Vulvovaginal atrophy, also known as atrophic vaginitis, is a condition that's associated with decreased estrogen levels in the body. It's common in women who are going through menopause or perimenopause. The decrease in estrogen can cause thinning, drying, and inflammation of the vaginal walls, which can lead to symptoms like vaginal dryness, burning, and irritation, as well as discomfort during sexual intercourse. It's critical to remember that this is a common condition and there are treatments available to help manage the symptoms. Would you like to know more about the treatments or do you have any other questions about this condition? \n\n Patient: No. That's fine. Thank you. \n\n Nurse: You're welcome. I see that you were prescribed new medications, the Estradiol Patch and Progesterone. Have you been able to pick up or receive these new medications? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear. Let's go over these new medications one by one. Have you started using the Estradiol Patch? It's applied to the lower part of your stomach or upper buttock, and you should change the patch and rotate the location every 3 or 4 days. \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: That's excellent, Ms. Robertson. You're doing a great job managing your health. Now, let's talk about the Progesterone. This is a 200 mg oral capsule that you should take once a day at bedtime. Have you started taking this medication as well? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Robertson. You're really taking charge of your health. Have you noticed any side effects from either the Estradiol Patch or the Progesterone that you're concerned about? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Ms. Robertson. The Progesterone is actually administered in a cream or gel form, not a capsule. I'm glad to hear you haven't experienced any side effects. Do you have any questions about how to use the Estradiol Patch or the Progesterone cream? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Okay. I'm sure your provider mentioned that the Estradiol Patch can take a few weeks to start working. Did they cover that with you? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear. I know it can be hard to wait for the results. On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to staying on the medication until it starts working? \n\n Patient: Ten. \n\n Nurse: That's fantastic to hear, Ms. Robertson. Your commitment is key to managing your symptoms effectively. Would you be interested in discussing some suggestions to mitigate the symptoms you're experiencing in the meantime? \n\n Patient: Sure. \n\n Nurse: I see that you've been experiencing a few different menopause-related symptoms. Which ones are currently bothering you the most? \n\n Patient: The hot flashes. \n\n Nurse: I can imagine how uncomfortable hot flashes can be. On a scale of 1-10, how disruptive would you say these hot flashes are to your daily life? \n\n Patient: Seven. \n\n Nurse: I see, a seven. That's quite disruptive. I'm sure you're really hoping the Estradiol will help with this. In the meantime, you might find it helpful to dress in layers so you can adjust your clothing to your body temperature, and try to identify any triggers for your hot flashes, such as spicy foods or caffeine. Would you be willing to try these suggestions? \n\n Patient: Sure. \n\n Nurse: That's great to hear. Besides hot flashes, we often hear about other symptoms from our patients like brain fog, headaches, bladder issues, and hair loss. Are you experiencing any of these symptoms? \n\n Patient: I get headache sometimes. \n\n Nurse: Just to make sure I heard you correctly, did you say you've been experiencing headaches? \n\n Patient: Sometimes, \n\n Nurse: When did these headaches start, Ms. Robertson? \n\n Patient: Oh, I don't have one right now. I just Patient: Sometimes I get them. \n\n\n <<SYS>> <TASK>Please ask the next follow up question from the <KICKOUT_CHECKLIST> section for the headache kickout.
