Is this Francine Meyer? \n\n Patient: Yes. It is. \n\n Nurse: Great, I'm calling on behalf of Evernow. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth? \n\n Patient: Zero one zero one nineteen seventy \n\n Nurse: Thanks for confirming that. I'm your AI Menopause Specialist. Evernow asked me to check in on how you're doing with your new medications. How are you doing today? \n\n Patient: Do any of these medications help with my blood pressure? The new ones. \n\n Nurse: I'm sorry, could you please repeat your question? I want to make sure I understand you correctly. \n\n Patient: Do any of the new men vacations that I have at least need help with my blood pressure. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- you're asking about the impact of your new medications on your blood pressure. The new medications you've been prescribed, which include Vaginal Estradiol Tablet, Progesterone, and Minoxidil, are primarily aimed at managing your perimenopausal symptoms. They are not specifically designed to treat hypertension. \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: The new medications you've been prescribed, which include Vaginal Estradiol Tablet, Progesterone, and Minoxidil, are primarily aimed at managing your perimenopausal symptoms. They are not specifically designed to treat hypertension. However, it's always a good idea to monitor your blood pressure regularly while starting any new medication. Have you been able to do that? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: That's excellent, Ms. Meyer. Regular monitoring can help you and your healthcare team understand how your body is responding to the new medications. Now, have you received your new medications: the Vaginal Estradiol Tablet, Progesterone, and Minoxidil? \n\n Patient: Yes. About how long does it take for the medication to work? \n\n Nurse: I see you're eager to start feeling better, and that's completely understandable. The Vaginal Estradiol Tablet, for instance, may show initial improvement in symptoms as early as 2 to 4 weeks after starting treatment. Full relief is typically experienced after 2 to 3 months. Similarly, Progesterone and Minoxidil may also take a few weeks to show noticeable effects. Have you started taking these medications yet? \n\n Patient: Yes. I have. \n\n Nurse: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Meyer. You're taking positive steps towards managing your symptoms. Now, let's go over each medication to ensure you're taking them as prescribed. Let's start with the Vaginal Estradiol Tablet. You should be placing the tablet every night immediately before bed for the first two weeks. After this 2-week \u201cloading dose\u201d, you will only use the medication 2 nights a week. Is this how you've been taking it? \n\n Patient: No. I thought that I'd take it with water. \n\n Nurse: I see where the confusion might have come from. The Vaginal Estradiol Tablet is actually meant to be inserted vaginally, not taken orally. It's designed to be absorbed directly through the vaginal tissues to help alleviate symptoms like vaginal dryness. Would you like me to go over the insertion process with you? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Okay then. Let's move on to the next medication, Progesterone. You should be taking a 200 mg capsule once a day at bedtime. Have you been taking it this way? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear. Lastly, let's discuss the Minoxidil. The prescribed dosage is a 1.25 mg oral tablet. Have you been taking it as directed? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: That's excellent, you're doing a great job managing your new medications. Since you've started taking these medications, have you noticed any side effects that concern you? \n\n Patient: Well, I haven't been able to sleep lady. \n\n Nurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier, Ms. Meyer. The Minoxidil is actually a topical solution that you apply directly to your scalp to help with hair loss, not an oral tablet. I'm sorry for any misunderstanding. Now, about your sleep issue, it's not uncommon to experience some sleep disturbances when starting new medications. However, it's important to monitor this. Can you tell me more about what you're experiencing? Are you having trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both? \n\n Patient: Both. And my question is, really, have a defect on my blood pressure. \n\n Nurse: Just to make sure I heard you correctly, did you say that you're concerned about the effect of these medications on your blood pressure? \n\n Patient: Yes. Patient: Well, me not giving any sleep. \n\n Nurse: I see, you're concerned that your sleep disturbances might be affecting your blood pressure. Sleep issues can indeed have an impact on blood pressure. It's critical to manage both your sleep and your hypertension. Have you noticed any changes in your blood pressure readings since you started experiencing these sleep issues? \n\n Patient: Well, it does seem to be a little bit higher. \n\n Nurse: Got it -- It's good that you're keeping an eye on your blood pressure. Changes in sleep patterns can sometimes affect blood pressure, but it's also important to consider other factors like diet, exercise, and stress. Have you noticed any changes in these areas recently? \n\n Patient: Maybe three. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- Stress can indeed have an impact on both sleep and blood pressure. It's critical to find ways to manage stress effectively. Do you currently have any stress management techniques that you use? \n\n Patient: Yes. D breathing. Patient: Can you see breathing? \n\n\n <<SYS>> <TASK>Please ask the next follow up question from the <KICKOUT_CHECKLIST> section for the shortness_of_breath kickout.
