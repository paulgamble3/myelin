Is this Janet Phan? \n\n Patient: Yeah. \n\n Nurse: Thanks for taking my call. Just so you know, I'm your AI Chronic Care Manager. Thousands of real doctors and nurses helped train me to care for patients like you. I've also studied hundreds of medical certification exams and your care team provided me with notes to prepare for this call. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth before we begin? \n\n Patient: November fourth nineteen fifty. \n\n Nurse: Thank you for confirming that, Ms. Phan. I hope you're settling in well after your recent hospital stay. How are you feeling since you've been home? \n\n Patient: I feel okay for the most part. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're feeling okay, Ms. Phan. It must be a relief to be back in your own space. Is there anything in particular you've been looking forward to doing now that you're home? \n\n Patient: I just really was looking forward to the peace and quiet the hospital was very loud. \n\n Nurse: I can imagine how the quiet of your own home is a welcome change from the hospital environment. It's often the simple things we miss the most, isn't it? Do you have any hobbies or activities that you enjoy doing at home that help you relax? \n\n Patient: Yes. Cuddling with my cats. \n\n Nurse: That sounds lovely, Ms. Phan. Pets can be such a source of comfort. How many cats do you have and what are their names? \n\n Patient: I have one cat, and his name is theodore. \n\n Nurse: Theodore sounds like a wonderful companion. Cats can be such a source of comfort and joy. I'm sure he's happy to have you back home as well. Before we move on, I wanted to let you know that I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Miguel Strother and we have a few topics to cover today. Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address before we get started on our list? \n\n Patient: Yeah. Actually, I'm not sure if this is because I was in the hospital and whatnot, but I've been feeling kind of constipated. \n\n Nurse: ",
