Are you keeping track of that as well? \n\n Patient: Yeah. But I shouldn't have to eat as many of them. \n\n Nurse: That's correct.

Are you comfortable with this recommendation? \n\n Patient: Yeah. There anything else I can do to help my weight problem? \n\n Nurse: Absolutely, there are a few strategies that can help.

Drinking plenty of water and getting enough sleep can also aid in weight loss. Lastly, finding a support system, whether it's friends, family, or a support group, can make the journey easier. Do you think any of these strategies would work for you?",
