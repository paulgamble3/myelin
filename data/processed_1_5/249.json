Is this Lanlan Dang? \n\n Patient: Yes, ma'am. This is Lanlan. \n\n Nurse: Thanks for taking my call. Just so you know, I'm your AI Pre-Op Specialist. Thousands of real doctors and nurses helped train me to care for patients like you. I've also studied hundreds of medical certification exams and your care team provided me with notes to prepare for this call. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth before we begin? \n\n Patient: March fourteenth nineteen sixty eight. \n\n Nurse: Thank you for confirming that, Mr. Dang. I'm calling to help you prepare for your upcoming colonoscopy on August 17th. Is this a good time to talk? \n\n Patient: Sure. Yes. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. How has your day been so far, Mr. Dang? \n\n Patient: So far, pretty good. \n\n Nurse: That's nice to hear, Mr. Dang. Have you been able to do anything enjoyable today? \n\n Patient: I went for a bike ride this morning. \n\n Nurse: That sounds like a wonderful way to start the day, Mr. Dang. Cycling is a great form of exercise. How often do you go for bike rides? \n\n Patient: Well, I try and go as much as I ten. So at least several times a week, usually, as long as the weather hold out for me. Although, I do have a Peloton bike so I can ride indoors if I want. \n\n Nurse: That's impressive, Mr. Dang. Regular exercise like cycling can contribute positively to your overall health. Do you find that your indoor cycling sessions on the Peloton are as enjoyable as your outdoor rides? \n\n Patient: Mostly, no. I enjoy being outside more. But I I really have to be careful. I have atrial fibrillation and Sometimes, I'm just not feeling up to it. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- Mr. Dang. It's good that you're aware of your limits and are taking care of your health. Atrial fibrillation can indeed make physical activities more challenging. Have you noticed any patterns or specific triggers that seem to affect your atrial fibrillation? \n\n Patient: Sometimes the weather affects Patient: it, which is is that a thing? Like or it seems that when it's cold, then it affects it more. \n\n Nurse: Yes, Mr. Dang, changes in weather can sometimes affect people with heart conditions like atrial fibrillation. Cold weather can cause your blood vessels to narrow, which makes your heart work harder to pump blood. This could potentially trigger an atrial fibrillation episode. It's always a good idea to dress warmly and try to stay indoors when it's very cold. Have you discussed this with your cardiologist? \n\n Patient: No. I haven't. I didn't I wasn't sure if it was really thing. So thank you for clarifying, and now I know that I probably should. Talk to my cardiologist about it. \n\n Nurse: Yes, Mr. Dang, it would be beneficial to discuss this with your cardiologist. They can provide you with more personalized advice based on your health history. I'll make a note of this for your care team to review. Moving on, I see that you have a colonoscopy scheduled for August 17th. How are you feeling about this upcoming procedure? \n\n Patient: Well, you know, I really don't like colonoscopies. I've only had one before. But with this weird stomach pain I've been having, you know, guess, I need to get it done and see if something's going on. \n\n Nurse: I can see why you might feel that way, Mr. Dang. Colonoscopies can be uncomfortable, but they are a very effective way to investigate unexplained abdominal pain. I hope this procedure will provide you and your doctor with the answers you're looking for. Do you have any specific questions or concerns about the procedure that you'd like to discuss before we move on? \n\n Patient: I wondered how long is the procedure will I be able to work after it? \n\n Nurse: The colonoscopy procedure itself usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. However, you'll need to rest and recover for a bit afterwards, so it's generally recommended not to work on the day of the procedure. \n\n Patient: Okay. That that makes sense. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Dang. I'm here to ensure you have everything you need for your colonoscopy. Do you have about 15 minutes to go over a few topics to help you prepare for your procedure? \n\n Patient: Absolutely. \n\n Nurse: Thank you, Mr. Dang. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. Your colonoscopy procedure is scheduled for August 17 at 10:00 AM with Doctor Jennifer Alvarez. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before your procedure, so at 9:00 AM. Does that work for you? \n\n Patient: It does work for me. Yes. \n\n Nurse: Perfect, Mr. Dang. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? \n\n Patient: Yes. I'm quite familiar with the hospital. So I should be fine getting there. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Dang. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? \n\n Patient: No. I I should be fine. I've been having a little bit of pain in my knee. So is the parking far \n\n Nurse: I'm sorry to hear about your knee pain, Mr. Dang. The hospital does have parking facilities close to the entrance. However, if you find the distance challenging, you might consider having someone drop you off at the entrance. How have you been managing your knee pain? \n\n Patient: Well, I have been taking Tylenol when I need to. Luckily, it's been several weeks, but I just feel like you know, I'm due for some knee pain since it's been a while. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- Mr. Dang. It's good that you've found some relief with Tylenol. However, it's important to note that Tylenol and other over-the-counter medications like Advil, Aspirin, and Aleve are typically stopped before a colonoscopy. Are you taking any other medications like these or other blood thinners? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: That's good to know, Mr. Dang. I see on your chart that you're currently taking Xarelto 10 mg once a day. For your upcoming colonoscopy, you'll need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before the procedure. That means you should stop taking it on August 12th. Does that make sense? \n\n Patient: It does make total sense. Thank you. \n\n Nurse: I apologize for any confusion, Mr. Dang. To clarify, your prescription for Xarelto is 10 mg, and the dosage is 10 mg once a day. You'll need to stop taking Xarelto 5 days before your procedure, which is on August 12th. Do you have any questions about this medication? \n\n Patient: No. I have no questions at all. \n\n Nurse: Alrighty then -- Mr. Dang. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's talk about your diet in preparation for the colonoscopy. You'll want to start eating a low fiber diet today. This includes foods like white bread, pasta, and rice, and avoiding foods like whole grains, nuts, and raw fruits and vegetables. Does that sound doable to you? \n\n Patient: Yes. I'm pretty sure I can handle that. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Dang. Do you have any questions about what foods you can and cannot eat while on a low fiber diet? \n\n Patient: No. I understand how low fiber work and it makes sense since I'm having a colonoscopy to make things easier. With the prep. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you're familiar with a low fiber diet, Mr. Dang. It's indeed helpful in preparing for a colonoscopy. Now, I'm curious, what are some low fiber foods that you enjoy as comfort food? \n\n Patient: Pasta rice \n\n Nurse: Pasta and rice are indeed good choices for a low fiber diet, Mr. Dang. Do you have any favorite recipes or ways you like to prepare these foods? \n\n Patient: A lot of different \n\n\n <<SYS>> <TASK>Please ask the next follow up question from the <KICKOUT_CHECKLIST> section for the eating_highfiber kickout. DO NOT respond to how the patient is feeling.</TASK><</SYS>>\nPatient: ways, but I was going to ask you, I'm really trying to lose some weight. And I I'm not sure, you know, what the best diet choices are to lose weight. \n\n Nurse: I appreciate your question, Mr. Dang. While a low fiber diet is necessary for your colonoscopy preparation, it's not typically recommended for weight loss. For weight loss, a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains is usually recommended. However, for now, let's focus on your colonoscopy preparation. After the procedure, you can return to a more balanced diet. Does that help clarify things for you? \n\n Patient: It does. Thank you, Rachel. \n\n Nurse: You're welcome, Mr. Dang. I'm glad I could help clarify that for you. Now, let's move on to the topic of supplements. For your colonoscopy, you'll need to stop any supplements you take, like Psyllium husk, or any anti-diarrheal medications. Are you currently taking any supplements or anti-diarrheal medications? \n\n Patient: No. I'm not. \n\n Nurse: That's good to know, Mr. Dang. If you have any questions about this or decide to start taking any supplements, please let us know. Now, I'd like to move onto the instructions for the clear liquid diet and NuLYTELY laxative solution. This is often the hardest part of the prep. How are you feeling about it? \n\n Patient: I'm just ready to get it over with the prep the worst part. \n\n Nurse: I hear you, Mr. Dang. Many people share your sentiment that the preparation can be the most challenging part of the process. But remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any specific questions or concerns about the prep? \n\n Patient: No. I've done it before. So No. I'm I'm ready to get it over with. \n\n Nurse: I appreciate your readiness, Mr. Dang. Just to remind you, you don't have to start the bowel prep just yet. You'll need to start 24 hours before your procedure by drinking only clear liquids. This involves no solid foods and drinking either clear or light colored beverages without any red or purple dye. Can I share some examples of what clear liquids are, and then you can tell me what questions you have about the diet? \n\n Patient: Sure. I mean, I think I understand. But, yeah, I'll I'll take some examples. \n\n Nurse: Of course, Mr. Dang. Examples of clear liquids include water, green tea, clear broth, light colored sports drinks, and jello or other gelatin without fruit or red color. It's essential to stay hydrated during this time, so please make sure to drink plenty of these clear liquids. Do you have any questions about these diet changes? \n\n Patient: No. I understand. \n\n Nurse: Okay then, Mr. Dang. I'm glad to hear that you understand. Now, the other main step to remember is drinking the NuLYTELY laxative solution the night before your procedure. The instructions can be a bit complicated, so I'll go over them step by step, okay? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: Great. First, you'll prepare your NuLYTELY around noon the day before your procedure. You'll fill the bottle half full with water, shake it thoroughly, then fill it all the way to the top fill line. Then place it in the refrigerator to chill because that makes it easier to drink. Does that make sense so far, Mr. Dang? \n\n Patient: Yes. It makes sense. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Mr. Dang. Next, at 6PM the night before your procedure, you'll drink an 8 ounce glass of the NuLYTELY solution every 10 to 15 minutes until the bottle is half empty. Then you should place the bottle back in the fridge. Have you got that so far? \n\n Patient: I've got that. Yes. \n\n Nurse: ",
