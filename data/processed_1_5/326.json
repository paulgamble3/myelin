Is this Francine Meyer? \n\n Patient: Whatever now, \n\n Nurse: I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Can you please confirm if this is Francine Meyer? \n\n Patient: Yes. This is Francine Meyer. What is Evernow? \n\n Nurse: Great, I'm calling on behalf of Evernow. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth? \n\n Patient: Before I share my date of birth, I need to know who you're where you're calling from. \n\n Nurse: I apologize for any confusion. Evernow is a healthcare service that works with your primary care doctor, Doctor Emily Hu, to provide additional support for your chronic care management. We help monitor your health and communicate any important information back to your doctor. Can you please provide your date of birth for verification purposes? \n\n Patient: Okay. Sure. January first nineteen seventy. \n\n Nurse: Thanks for confirming that. I'm your AI Menopause Specialist. Evernow asked me to check in on how you're doing with your new medications. How are you doing today? \n\n Patient: Doing fine. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have about 15 minutes for a quick check-in? \n\n Patient: Sure. I have time for a quick checking. \n\n Nurse: Perfect, thank you. Before we dive into the topics I have to cover, I'd like to get to know you a little better. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? \n\n Patient: I don't have anything particular coming up this week that \n\n Nurse: That's perfectly fine. Sometimes, it's nice to have a quiet week. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you enjoy doing in your free time? \n\n Patient: Yeah. Enjoy painting. \n\n Nurse: That's wonderful! Painting can be such a therapeutic activity. What kind of painting do you enjoy - is it watercolor, oil, or something else? \n\n Patient: Oh, I enjoy Watercolor painting. \n\n Nurse: Watercolor painting sounds lovely. Do you have a favorite subject or theme that you like to paint? \n\n Patient: Nature, Flowers, trees. Patient: For us. Patient: Landscape. \n\n Nurse: That sounds beautiful. Nature and landscapes can be so inspiring. Do you have a favorite place or type of landscape that you like to paint? For example, do you prefer painting forests, mountains, or maybe seascapes? \n\n Patient: I'll do all of them. Each one is a different challenge. \n\n Nurse: That's a wonderful perspective, embracing the challenge each landscape brings. It must be very rewarding to see your finished pieces. Now, before we move on to discuss your new medications, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Alrighty then -- I see that you were recently prescribed new medications: Vaginal Estradiol Tablet, Progesterone, and Minoxidil. Have you been able to pick up or receive these medications? \n\n Patient: Yeah. I picked them up, but I'm not really sure about the directions for the vaginal estradiol. \n\n Nurse: Got it -- Let's go over the instructions for the Vaginal Estradiol Tablet. During the first two weeks of your treatment, you will place the tablet every night immediately before bed. After this 2-week \u201cloading dose\u201d, you will only use the medication 2 nights a week. Does that help clarify the instructions for you? \n\n Patient: How do I insert the tablet? \n\n Nurse: The vaginal estradiol tablet is typically inserted with an applicator. Here's a general step-by-step guide: Wash your hands thoroughly. Remove the tablet from its packaging and place it into the applicator as instructed by the packaging or your pharmacist. Find a comfortable position. This could be standing with one foot raised on a chair, sitting on the edge of a chair, or lying down with your knees bent and legs apart. Hold the applicator containing the tablet by the opposite end from where the tablet is. Gently insert the applicator into your vagina as far as it will comfortably go. You can use a small amount of water-based lubricant to help if needed. Push the plunger of the applicator to release the tablet. Gently remove the applicator. Wash the applicator with warm soapy water, rinse it, and let it air dry. Remember, it's best to insert the tablet right before you go to bed. This helps keep the tablet in place and gives it time to dissolve. Is that clear? \n\n Patient: So it's basically, like, inserting a tampon. The same concept. \n\n Nurse: Yes, the concept is similar to inserting a tampon. Now, let's move on to the next medication. You were also prescribed Progesterone 200 Mg Oral Capsule. The dosage for this is 200 mg once a day at bedtime. Have you started taking this medication? \n\n Patient: What do I do if the tab was falls out? Patient: So I just push it back in. \n\n Nurse: I apologize for any confusion earlier. The process is actually more similar to using a vaginal suppository than a tampon. If the tablet falls out, it's best not to reinsert it. Instead, you can insert a new tablet. However, if you find that the tablet is falling out frequently, it would be a good idea to discuss this with your healthcare provider to ensure the medication is being administered effectively. Does that help clarify things? \n\n Patient: Sure. \n\n Nurse: Excellent, let's move on to the next medication. You were also prescribed Progesterone 200 Mg Oral Capsule. The dosage for this is 200 mg once a day at bedtime. Have you started taking this medication? \n\n Patient: I'm kinda nervous about taking it because I'm afraid gonna mess up my hormones and affect many things in my body. \n\n Nurse: I can see why you might feel that way. Starting a new medication, especially one that affects hormones, can feel a bit daunting. Progesterone is actually a hormone that your body naturally produces. The medication is intended to supplement your body's own production and help balance your hormone levels. It's been prescribed to help manage your perimenopausal symptoms. Would you like me to note down your concerns so your healthcare provider can address them? \n\n Patient: Yeah. I know it's a natural hormone, but if I have too much in the my body, it'll throw Patient: things are. \n\n Nurse: I hear your concerns. It's true that maintaining a balance of hormones is key. The dosage prescribed by your doctor is based on your specific needs and is intended to help restore this balance. However, it's important to monitor how you're feeling while on the medication. If you notice any changes or have any concerns, it's crucial to communicate this with your healthcare provider. Would you like me to make a note of your concerns for your doctor? \n\n Patient: What are some signs of high progesterone levels in your body. I'd like to know so I can walk out for these symptoms. \n\n Nurse: Signs of high progesterone can include bloating, mood swings, drowsiness, and breast tenderness. If you notice any of these symptoms, it's important to communicate this with your healthcare provider. \n\n Patient: [NO RESPONSE] Okay. Okay. Never mind. \n\n Nurse: Okay, let's move on to the last medication. You were also prescribed Minoxidil 2.5 mg Oral Tablet. The dosage for this is 1.25 mg. Have you started taking this medication? \n\n Patient: Yeah. I'm not really sure what that's for either. \n\n Nurse: Minoxidil is a medication that's often used to help slow or stop hair loss, and in some cases, it can even help regrow hair. It's been prescribed to help manage the hair loss you've been experiencing. Have you noticed any changes since you started taking it? \n\n Patient: I haven't sent it Patient: taking it, but I'm afraid of taking too much medication. Wouldn't it be better just use Rosemary? Patient: Mary Oil on my scalp. \n\n Nurse: I apologize for the confusion earlier. The correct dosage for the Minoxidil is 2.5 mg, not 1.25 mg. As for your question, while some people find natural remedies like rosemary oil helpful, they may not be as effective as a medication like Minoxidil. However, it's important to do what feels right for you. Would you like me to note your preference for natural remedies for your healthcare provider? \n\n Patient: Yes, please. Note note that in because I just don't want to be taking too many medications. So throw off in my hormones and making feel worse. \n\n Nurse: I've made a note of your preference for natural remedies and your concerns about taking multiple medications. It's essential to feel comfortable with your treatment plan, and your healthcare provider can help address these concerns. Now, have you experienced any side effects from the medications that you've started? \n\n Patient: Not yet, but I will can I ask for that? \n\n Nurse: Absolutely, it's important to monitor how you're feeling while on these medications. If you notice any changes or have any concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider. \n\n Patient: [NO RESPONSE] \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear you haven't experienced any side effects so far. It's critical to keep an eye out for any changes as you continue your medication. Now, I'd like to discuss how these medications work. Your provider may have mentioned that the Estradiol can take a few weeks to start working. Did they cover that with you? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- \n\n Patient: I didn't know about that. Why does it take two weeks that they're working? \n\n Nurse: Estradiol, like many hormone therapies, doesn't provide immediate relief because it's working to rebalance your hormone levels. This process takes time. Most women start to feel the benefits of the treatment, including a reduction in hot flashes and night sweats, and better sleep, within 2 to 4 weeks. However, for some women, it may take 2 to 3 months to see significant improvement in their symptoms. Does that help explain why it takes a bit of time to start working? \n\n Patient: Yeah. That makes sense. And that's good information to know. How long does menopause usually take? \n\n Nurse: Menopause is a natural process that varies greatly from woman to woman. On average, women reach menopause around age 51, but it can occur earlier or later. The transition to menopause, or perimenopause, can last several years. After a woman has gone a full year without a menstrual period, she's considered to be postmenopausal. Symptoms can continue into postmenopause, but they usually lessen over time. Does that answer your question? \n\n Patient: What exactly is the causing that pause? \n\n Nurse: Menopause is a natural biological process that marks the end of a woman's menstrual cycles. It's diagnosed after you've gone 12 months without a menstrual period. Menopause can happen in your 40s or 50s, but the average age is 51 in the United States. It's caused by a natural decline in reproductive hormones when your ovaries no longer release an egg every month and menstruation stops. Does that help clarify things? \n\n Patient: If I were to get it hysterectomy, then would my body go into menopause? \n\n Nurse: If you have a hysterectomy, which is the surgical removal of the uterus, it can lead to immediate menopause if the ovaries are also removed. This is because the ovaries produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which control menstruation. If the ovaries are left intact, they can still produce these hormones, so menopause would not occur immediately. However, menopause may occur earlier than it naturally would. Does that answer your question? \n\n Patient: So I have to take progesterone tablets for the rest of my life? \n\n Nurse: Not necessarily. The duration of your treatment with progesterone tablets depends on several factors, including your symptoms, overall health, and how your body responds to the medication. Your healthcare provider will monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed. It's critical to have regular check-ins with your provider to discuss how you're feeling and any changes in your symptoms. Does that help clarify things? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. I know it can be hard to wait for the results. On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to staying on the medication until it starts working? \n\n Patient: I'm not really sure yet. I haven't started because there wasn't it wasn't clear on how it is. Cert, Patient: But once they start the medication, depending on the side effects, I'll let to know how I feel about it. \n\n Nurse: That's completely understandable. Starting a new medication can feel a bit uncertain, especially when it comes to potential side effects. It's important to listen to your body and communicate any changes or concerns to your healthcare provider. Would you be interested in discussing some suggestions to help manage the symptoms you're experiencing in the meantime? \n\n Patient: Okay. \n\n Nurse: I notice from your records that you've been experiencing a few different menopause-related symptoms. Which ones are currently bothering you the most? \n\n Patient: The change in my temperature, my body temperature. \n\n Nurse: Just to make sure I heard you correctly, did you say that you're experiencing a change in your body temperature? \n\n Patient: Yeah. Because I'm gonna get really, really Patient: hot, and then I'll get really, really cold a few minutes later. \n\n Nurse: I see. Could you tell me what your temperature is right now? \n\n Patient: Ninety eight point six. \n\n Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you're experiencing hot flashes, which are a common symptom of menopause. On a scale of 1-10, how disruptive to your life would you say these temperature changes are? \n\n Patient: Four out of ten. \n\n Nurse: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like these temperature changes are somewhat disruptive for you. I can imagine you're really hoping the Estradiol will help with this. In the meantime, would you be open to trying a couple of strategies to help manage these symptoms? \n\n Patient: Sure. \n\n\n <<SYS>> <TASK>The normal range for estradiol is 70 to 220 pmol/L.\nDon't specify unit unless patient asks for it.</TASK><</SYS>>\n\n\n Nurse: One strategy that might help is dressing in layers, which can be removed at the start of a hot flash. Clothing made of natural fibers, such as cotton, may be more comfortable. Another strategy is to keep a fan in your workspace or bedroom, which can help cool you down during a hot flash. Would you be willing to try these suggestions? \n\n Patient: Okay. \n\n Nurse: That's great to hear. Remember, these are just suggestions and it's important to find what works best for you. Now, we often hear about other symptoms from our patients like brain fog, headaches, bladder issues, and sexual problems like vaginal dryness. Are you experiencing any of these symptoms? \n\n Patient: Yeah. I'm experiencing a few of them. \n\n Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that. Could you please share which of these symptoms you're experiencing? \n\n Patient: My doctor already knows all this information. We already went over it. \n\n Nurse: Got it -- I apologize if it feels repetitive. It's just important for us to have a complete understanding of your symptoms so we can provide the best support possible. Another area that patients often ask for support is with how they can better advocate for themselves with their care team. Would you be interested in learning more about that? \n\n Patient: No. I don't think I need that right now. \n\n Nurse: ",
