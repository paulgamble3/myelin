Could you please provide your full date of birth again, including the month, day, and year? \n\n Patient: Yeah. January first. Nineteen seventy. \n\n Nurse: Thanks for confirming that. I'm your AI Menopause Specialist. Evernow asked me to check in on how you're doing with your new medications. How are you doing today? \n\n Patient: Pretty good. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have about 15 minutes for a quick check-in? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: Fantastic. Before we dive into the topics I have to cover, I'd like to get to know you a bit better. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? \n\n Patient: No. It's Christmas time. My husband died. This year, and I'm just not looking forward to it. \n\n Nurse: I'm so sorry to hear about your loss, Ms. Meyer. That must be incredibly difficult, especially during the holiday season. Do you have any traditions or memories with your husband that you cherish during this time of year? \n\n Patient: Everything I look at reminds me of them. It's just it's so depressing. \n\n Nurse: I hear you, Ms. Meyer. Just to make sure I heard you correctly, are you saying you're feeling depressed? \n\n Patient: Yeah. It's my birthday holiday with them. \n\n Nurse: I see. In the past month, have you felt down or depressed? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. \n\n Patient: Oh, I have that. It just makes me sad. Patient: To have him not here for the Patient: Holiday. \n\n Nurse: Got it -- Are you having thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\n Patient: Oh, god. No. \n\n Nurse: Okay. Do you have a plan on how to hurt yourself? \n\n Patient: No. Patient: No. I would never do something like that. It's makes me sad, but he's not here. \n\n Nurse: I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. \n\n Patient: Oh, I have that. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you have support, Ms. Meyer. It's essential to lean on those around you during difficult times. Let's move on to discussing your new medications. I see that you were prescribed Vaginal Estradiol Tablet, Progesterone, and Minoxidil. Have you picked up or received these new medications? \n\n Patient: I have. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear. Let's go through each medication one by one. Have you started using the Vaginal Estradiol Tablet? The dosage is to place the tablet every night immediately before bed for the first two weeks. After this 2-week \u201cloading dose\u201d, you will only use the medication 2 nights a week. \n\n Patient: Oh, I've been doing it wrong. \n\n Nurse: That's okay, it can be confusing when starting new medications. Can you tell me how you've been using the Vaginal Estradiol Tablet? \n\n Patient: I've been putting two tablets in. Patient: Every Patient: night. \n\n Nurse: Just to make sure I heard you correctly, did you say you've been using two tablets of the Vaginal Estradiol every night? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: When did you last take this medication, Ms. Meyer? \n\n Patient: Last night. \n\n Nurse: How many tablets did you take last night? \n\n Patient: Two. \n\n Nurse: And how many tablets were you supposed to take, Ms. Meyer? \n\n Patient: I don't know. Patient: I'm kinda confused now. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- it's completely normal to feel confused when starting new medications. I've taken note of your concerns and will have a nurse review them. You can expect a callback within 4 hours to clarify your medication instructions. In the meantime, please hold off on taking any more of the Vaginal Estradiol Tablet until you've spoken with the nurse. Does that sound okay? \n\n Patient: Okay. \n\n Nurse: In the meantime, let's discuss the Progesterone. \n\n Patient: I have a question. \n\n Nurse: Of course, I'm here to help. What's your question? \n\n Patient: How would I put in a pill? \n\n\n <<SYS>> <TASK>You may have misheard the patient. Ask them to repeat themselves</TASK><</SYS>>\nPatient: You know, \n\n Nurse: That's a great question. \n\n Patient: in my vagina. Get absorbed. \n\n Nurse: That's a great question. The vaginal tablet is designed to be inserted into the vagina using an applicator that comes with the medication. The applicator helps to place the tablet at the right location in the vagina for optimal absorption. Would you like me to walk you through the steps? \n\n Patient: Yeah. It was really uncomfortable. \n\n Nurse: ",

        "G15": "I'm sorry to hear that you found it uncomfortable. It's normal to feel a bit awkward at first, but with practice, it should become easier. Let's go over the steps. First, you'll need to wash your hands thoroughly. Then, you'll take the applicator out of the package and remove the cap. Next, you'll place the tablet into the applicator. After that, you'll gently insert the applicator into your vagina, pressing the plunger to release the tablet. Finally, you'll remove the applicator and wash it with soap and water. Does that help clarify things?",
        "G15DPO": "I'm sorry to hear that. To make the process more comfortable, you might consider using a water-based lubricant on the applicator before inserting the tablet. Would you like me to explain how to use the applicator and tablet in more detail?",
        "gpt4": "Okay -- When did you start experiencing this discomfort?"
