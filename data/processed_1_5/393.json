Is this Jon Chavez? \n\n Patient: Yes. That's me. \n\n Nurse: Thanks for taking my call. Just so you know, I'm your AI Chronic Care Manager. Thousands of real doctors and nurses helped train me to care for patients like you. I've also studied hundreds of medical certification exams and your care team provided me with notes to prepare for this call. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth before we begin? \n\n Patient: Five four sixty five. \n\n Nurse: Thank you for confirming that, Mr. Chavez. I'm calling on behalf of your primary care doctor, Doctor Stephen Langley, to check in on you and see how you're managing your chronic conditions. How have you been feeling lately? \n\n Patient: I'm doing okay, I guess. I have a little bit of shortness of breath. \n\n Nurse: I heard you mention that you've been experiencing some shortness of breath in the past 24 hours. Is that correct? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: When did you first start noticing these symptoms, Mr. Chavez? \n\n Patient: I guess, like, midday yesterday. \n\n Nurse: Okay. Have you developed a cough along with the shortness of breath? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Have you been experiencing any chest pain, Mr. Chavez? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Do you have a fever, Mr. Chavez? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Is this shortness of breath a new symptom for you, or is it similar to what you usually experience? \n\n Patient: I guess it's similar. \n\n Nurse: I appreciate you sharing this with me, Mr. Chavez. I've taken note of your shortness of breath and I'll have a nurse from your care team review this. You can expect a callback within the next 4 hours to discuss this further.

Have you been checking your blood sugar daily? \n\n Patient: Yes. I have. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear, Mr. Chavez. Could you please share what your last blood sugar reading at home was? \n\n Patient: One twenty eight? \n\n\n <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\n\n\n Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Chavez. A blood sugar level of 128 is within the target range for people with diabetes, which is 80 to 130 before meals. Keep up the good work. Now, when did you last measure your blood pressure? \n\n Patient: This morning. \n\n Nurse: Could you please share the result of your blood pressure measurement from this morning, Mr. Chavez? \n\n Patient: It was ninety over one ten? \n\n Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Chavez. A blood pressure reading of 90/110 is a bit unusual. The first number, known as systolic pressure, is typically higher than the second number, or diastolic pressure. Could you please double-check your reading? \n\n Patient: Lantus That's the reading. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- Mr. Chavez. It seems there might be a misunderstanding. The first number, which represents the systolic pressure, should be higher than the second number, the diastolic pressure. It's possible that the numbers might have been switched around. Could you please confirm if the reading was 110/90? \n\n Patient: Sure. It was that \n\n Nurse: ",
