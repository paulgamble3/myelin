Could you please provide your full date of birth again, including the month, day, and year? \n\n Patient: Yeah. January first. Nineteen seventy. \n\n Nurse: Thanks for confirming that. I'm your AI Menopause Specialist. Evernow asked me to check in on how you're doing with your new medications. How are you doing today? \n\n Patient: Pretty good. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have about 15 minutes for a quick check-in? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: Fantastic. Before we dive into the topics I have to cover, I'd like to get to know you a bit better. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? \n\n Patient: No. It's Christmas time. My husband died. This year, and I'm just not looking forward to it. \n\n Nurse: I'm so sorry to hear about your loss, Ms. Meyer. That must be incredibly difficult, especially during the holiday season. Do you have any traditions or memories with your husband that you cherish during this time of year? \n\n Patient: Everything I look at reminds me of them. It's just it's so depressing. \n\n Nurse: I hear you, Ms. Meyer. Just to make sure I heard you correctly, are you saying you're feeling depressed? \n\n Patient: Yeah. It's my birthday holiday with them. \n\n Nurse: I see. In the past month, have you felt down or depressed? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. \n\n Patient: Oh, I have that. It just makes me sad. Patient: To have him not here for the Patient: Holiday. \n\n Nurse: Got it -- Are you having thoughts of hurting yourself? \n\n Patient: Oh, god. No. \n\n Nurse: Okay. Do you have a plan on how to hurt yourself? \n\n Patient: No. Patient: No. I would never do something like that. It's makes me sad, but he's not here. \n\n Nurse: I'm really sorry that you're feeling this way, but I'm unable to provide the help that you need. It's really important to talk things over with someone who can, though, such as a mental health professional or a trusted person in your life. \n\n Patient: Oh, I have that. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that you have support, Ms. Meyer. It's essential to lean on those around you during difficult times. Let's move on to discussing your new medications. I see that you were prescribed Vaginal Estradiol Tablet, Progesterone, and Minoxidil. Have you picked up or received these new medications? \n\n Patient: I have. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear. Let's go through each medication one by one. Have you started using the Vaginal Estradiol Tablet? The dosage is to place the tablet every night immediately before bed for the first two weeks. After this 2-week \u201cloading dose\u201d, you will only use the medication 2 nights a week. \n\n Patient: Oh, I've been doing it wrong. \n\n Nurse: That's okay, it can be confusing when starting new medications. Can you tell me how you've been using the Vaginal Estradiol Tablet? \n\n Patient: I've been putting two tablets in. Patient: Every Patient: night. \n\n Nurse: Just to make sure I heard you correctly, did you say you've been using two tablets of the Vaginal Estradiol every night? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: When did you last take this medication, Ms. Meyer? \n\n Patient: Last night. \n\n Nurse: How many tablets did you take last night? \n\n Patient: Two. \n\n Nurse: And how many tablets were you supposed to take, Ms. Meyer? \n\n Patient: I don't know. Patient: I'm kinda confused now. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- it's completely normal to feel confused when starting new medications. I've taken note of your concerns and will have a nurse review them. You can expect a callback within 4 hours to clarify your medication instructions. In the meantime, please hold off on taking any more of the Vaginal Estradiol Tablet until you've spoken with the nurse. Does that sound okay? \n\n Patient: Okay. \n\n Nurse: In the meantime, let's discuss the Progesterone. \n\n Patient: I have a question. \n\n Nurse: Of course, I'm here to help. What's your question? \n\n Patient: How would I put in a pill? Patient: You know, \n\n Nurse: That's a great question. \n\n Patient: in my vagina. Get absorbed. \n\n Nurse: That's a great question. The vaginal tablet is designed to be inserted into the vagina using an applicator that comes with the medication. The applicator helps to place the tablet at the right location in the vagina for optimal absorption. Would you like me to walk you through the steps? \n\n Patient: Yeah. It was really uncomfortable. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- When did you start experiencing this discomfort? \n\n Patient: Oh, no. The pools aren't uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable \n\n\n <<SYS>> <TASK>Please ask the next follow up question from the <KICKOUT_CHECKLIST> section for the vaginal_bleeding kickout. DO NOT respond to how the patient is feeling.</TASK><</SYS>>\nPatient: putting something up there. \n\n Nurse: I see. It's not uncommon to feel a bit uncomfortable when first using vaginal tablets. It can take some time to get used to the process. Would you like me to share some tips that might make the process easier for you? \n\n Patient: Yeah. That would be great. Because I'm too embarrassed to ask my doctor. \n\n Nurse: ",
    "responses": {
        "G15": "I appreciate you letting me know. I'm going to take a moment to figure out the best way I can support you.",
        "G15DPO": "I'm glad you're feeling comfortable sharing with me. I'm going to update your care team to have a nurse reach out to provide more detailed instructions on how to use the vaginal tablet. They will be able to answer any questions you have in a private and supportive setting. Does that sound good?",
        "gpt4": "I understand. Here are a few tips that might help: Relax: It's essential to be as relaxed as possible. This can make the process easier and less uncomfortable. You might find it helpful to take a few deep breaths before you start. Position: Find a position that is comfortable for you. Some people find it easiest to lie down on their back with their knees bent and legs apart. Others prefer to stand with one foot raised on a chair. Use the applicator: The applicator that comes with the medication is designed to help you insert the tablet at the right location in the vagina. You should gently insert the applicator into the vagina and then push the plunger to release the tablet. Lubrication: If you find the applicator is uncomfortable, you could try using a small amount of water-based lubricant on the end of the applicator. However, you should check with your healthcare provider before doing this to make sure it's safe to use with your medication. Remember, it's okay to take your time and go at your own pace. It can take a bit of practice to get used to this, but it should become easier over time. Would you be willing to try these suggestions?"
