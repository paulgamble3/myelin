Thousands of real doctors and nurses helped train me to care for patients like you. I've also studied hundreds of medical certification exams and your care team provided me with notes to prepare for this call. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth before we begin? \n\n Patient: Absolutely. My date of birth is April third nineteen forty two. \n\n Nurse: Thank you for confirming that, Ms. Kourouma. I hope you're feeling comfortable at home after your recent hospital stay. How are you doing today? \n\n Patient: I guess I'm feeling a little bit overwhelmed. \n\n Nurse: I'm sorry to hear that you're feeling overwhelmed, Ms. Kourouma. It's completely normal to feel this way after a hospital stay. Is there anything specific that's causing you to feel this way? \n\n Patient: The new diagnosis the new medications, and the new diet, just a lot of changes all at once. \n\n Nurse: I can see how all these changes can be overwhelming, Ms. Kourouma. It's a lot to take in. I'm here to help you navigate through this. We can go over your medications and diet, and I can answer any questions you might have. But before we dive into that, I'd like to know a bit more about you. Do you have any hobbies or activities you enjoy doing at home? \n\n Patient: Well, I really like puzzles and the doke. \n\n Nurse: That's wonderful, Ms. Kourouma. Puzzles can be a great way to keep the mind sharp. Do you have a favorite type of puzzle you enjoy working on? And could you tell me more about the doke? Is that a pet or a hobby? \n\n Patient: I said Sadoku. \n\n\n <<SYS>> <TASK>If you think you misheard the patient, ask them to repeat themselves. Otherwise proceed.</TASK><</SYS>>\n\n\n Nurse: I apologize for misunderstanding, Ms. Kourouma. Sudoku puzzles can be quite engaging and challenging. How often do you work on them? \n\n Patient: Every day. \n\n Nurse: That's impressive, Ms. Kourouma. Sudoku puzzles can be quite challenging. It's a great way to keep your mind active. Now, I'm calling on behalf of Doctor Maria Rodriguez and I have a few topics to cover with you. Before we get started, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address? \n\n Patient: I mean, I have so many So I think it's better that you just go through what you need to, and then I'll ask if I have anything more to ask. \n\n Nurse: Absolutely, Ms. Kourouma. Let's start with your medications. I see that you're currently taking Valsartan, Lasix, and Metformin. Are you still taking these medications? \n\n Patient: Yeah. I am. But I'm having a hard time remembering when to take them. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- Ms. Kourouma. It's quite common to have trouble remembering when to take medications, especially when there are multiple ones. Would it be okay if I provide some suggestions to help you remember? \n\n Patient: That would be great. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad you're open to suggestions, Ms. Kourouma. One method that many people find helpful is using a pill organizer. They have compartments for each day of the week and times of the day. This can help you see at a glance whether you've taken your medications or not. Another method is setting reminders on your phone or a clock. You could set them for the times you need to take your medications. Lastly, linking your medication times to daily routines, like meals or brushing your teeth, can also be effective. Do any of these methods sound like they might work for you? \n\n Patient: Yeah. I think said Daily routine part is gonna be helpful. \n\n Nurse: That's a good choice, Ms. Kourouma. Linking your medication times to daily routines can make it easier to remember. It's like creating a mental note that pairs taking your medication with a routine task. Now, let's move on to checking your symptoms. Is it okay if I ask you a few questions to understand how you're doing at home? \n\n Patient: Yeah. \n\n Nurse: Thank you, Ms. Kourouma. Let's start with your breathing. Have you noticed any new or worsening shortness of breath with activity, laying down, or at rest? \n\n Patient: No. I haven't. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Kourouma. Now, have you experienced any ongoing or worsening chest pain recently? \n\n Patient: No chest pain. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Kourouma. How about a new or worsening dry cough?
