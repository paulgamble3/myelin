Just so you know, I'm your AI Pre-Op Specialist. Thousands of real doctors and nurses helped train me to care for patients like you. I've also studied hundreds of medical certification exams and your care team provided me with notes to prepare for this call. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth before we begin? \n\n Patient: August eight nineteen eighty one. \n\n Nurse: Thank you for confirming that, Ms. Kapoor. I'm calling about your upcoming total knee replacement on August 13th. Is this a good time to talk? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: Perfect. I hope your day is going well so far. What have you been up to today, Ms. Kapoor? \n\n Patient: Oh, I'm just relaxing. Today. \n\n Nurse: That sounds lovely, Ms. Kapoor. Relaxation is key, especially before a procedure. Do you have any favorite activities that help you unwind? \n\n Patient: You know, I just I'm reading a good book \n\n Nurse: That's wonderful, Ms. Kapoor. Reading is a great way to relax. What book are you currently reading? \n\n Patient: I am rereading pride and prejudice. Plavix. Right? \n\n Nurse: Ah, Pride and Prejudice, a classic! Jane Austen's work is timeless. Do you find something new each time you read it? And yes, you're correct about Plavix. You were instructed to stop taking it 7 days prior to your operation. Have you been able to do so? \n\n Patient: Yes. I have. \n\n Nurse: That's excellent to hear, Ms. Kapoor. Stopping Plavix as instructed is crucial for your upcoming procedure. Let's move on to the next topic. I'm sure you must be looking forward to getting a new knee. What are you planning to do once you've recovered from your knee replacement? \n\n Patient: Well, I I wanna go travel more. I think I'm looking forward to being more mobile. \n\n Nurse: That's a wonderful goal, Ms. Kapoor. Traveling can be such a rewarding experience. Do you have any specific destinations in mind that you'd like to visit once you're more mobile? \n\n Patient: I would love to go to Hawaii. \n\n Nurse: Hawaii sounds like a fantastic choice, Ms. Kapoor. The beautiful beaches, the warm weather, and the vibrant culture would certainly be a treat. Have you been there before or would this be your first time? \n\n Patient: It would be my first time. \n\n Nurse: That's exciting, Ms. Kapoor! A first trip to Hawaii is certainly something to look forward to. It's a beautiful place with so much to offer. Now, let's talk a bit about your upcoming procedure. How are you feeling about your total knee replacement? \n\n Patient: Well, can I ask you something is not related to my knee replacement? \n\n Nurse: Of course, Ms. Kapoor. Feel free to ask anything you'd like. What's on your mind? \n\n Patient: So I noticed I have some works? Patient: On my private parts. And I'm Patient: Very concerned. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- Ms. Kapoor. To confirm, you're saying you've noticed lesions on your genitals within the past 24 hours, is that correct? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: Got it -- When did these symptoms start, Ms. Kapoor? \n\n Patient: I I noticed it a few days ago. \n\n Nurse: Got it -- Ms. Kapoor. I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing this. It's good that you're paying attention to changes in your body. Are you experiencing any other symptoms such as itching, burning, or discomfort in the area? \n\n Patient: No. Well, a little itching. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- Ms. Kapoor. It's critical to get this checked out. I recommend you schedule an appointment with your primary care provider or a dermatologist as soon as possible. They can examine the area and provide a diagnosis and treatment plan. In the meantime, try not to scratch the area as it can lead to further irritation or infection. Does that sound okay to you? \n\n Patient: Okay. Yeah. That's fine. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Kapoor. It's always best to get these things checked out. Now, if it's okay with you, I'd like to return to discussing your upcoming knee replacement. Do you have any specific questions or concerns about the procedure that you'd like to go over before we begin? Remember, you can ask me questions at any time during our call. \n\n Patient: No. No questions. \n\n Nurse: Alright, Ms. Kapoor. Please remember that you can ask questions at any time. I'm calling today to ensure you have everything you need for your upcoming procedure. Is it okay if we review a few topics together? \n\n Patient: Certainly. \n\n Nurse: Thank you, Ms. Kapoor. Let's first get all the logistics out of the way. You are scheduled for a Left knee total knee replacement procedure on August 13th at 9:00 AM with Doctor Sarah Wu. You'll need to arrive about 1 hour before at 8:00 AM. Is that okay with you? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: Excellent, Ms. Kapoor. Once you get to O'Connor Hospital, your check-in location will be on the 1st Floor. Does that sound good to you? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: Perfect, Ms. Kapoor. Is there anything else about the logistics that's worrying you or that you'd like to discuss? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Okay then, Ms. Kapoor. I'm glad to hear that. I'd like to move on to discuss your medications. Is it okay if we proceed? \n\n Patient: Yes. Because I am on a bunch of those. \n\n Nurse: Okay -- Ms. Kapoor. It's important to manage your medications properly, especially around the time of your surgery. I see on your chart that you're taking Plavix 75 mg once a day. You were instructed to stop this medication 7 days prior to your procedure. Can you confirm that you've stopped taking Plavix? \n\n Patient: Yes. And didn't we already talk about this? \n\n Nurse: Yes, we did touch on this earlier, Ms. Kapoor. I apologize for the repetition. It's just crucial to ensure all medication changes are clear. Now, are you taking any other medications like Advil, Aspirin, Aleve, or other blood thinners? \n\n Patient: I I do take Advil. Yes. \n\n Nurse: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kapoor. Similar to Plavix, Advil is a medication that typically needs to be stopped before a knee replacement unless your doctor specifically recommended otherwise. Have you received any specific instructions about your Advil intake? \n\n Patient: No. Could you tell me when I'm supposed to do with that? \n\n Nurse: Of course, Ms. Kapoor. Advil, like other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. Therefore, it's generally recommended to stop taking it at least 24 hours before surgery. However, please confirm this with your healthcare provider as individual recommendations can vary. Does that help clarify things for you? \n\n Patient: Yes. It's a \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Kapoor. Now, I also notice that you've been prescribed Tylenol and Tramadol for after the procedure. Have you picked up these medications yet? \n\n Patient: Yes. I have. \n\n Nurse: That's great to hear, Ms. Kapoor. Having your medications ready in advance will help ensure a smoother recovery process. Do you have any questions about these medications or any others that you're currently taking? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Alrighty then -- Ms. Kapoor. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to ask. Now, let's move on to discuss how you can prepare your skin for surgery to reduce the risk of infection. Have you already purchased a chlorhexidine scrub? It's available at most pharmacies over the counter. \n\n Patient: [NO RESPONSE] Yes. \n\n Nurse: That's great, Ms. Kapoor. Using a chlorhexidine scrub is an important step in preparing for your surgery. Let's go over the instructions for using the scrub. You'll need to use it the night before and the morning of your procedure. Does that sound okay so far? \n\n Patient: Yeah. \n\n Nurse: Excellent, Ms. Kapoor. After you've taken a shower like normal and turned the water off, you'll want to apply the scrub to a wet, clean washcloth. Then, gently scrub yourself from the neck down. It's essential to avoid using the scrub on your face, hair, or genital area. Can you do that? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: Wonderful, Ms. Kapoor. After you've scrubbed for about 5 minutes, you'll rinse the solution off and pat dry with a clean towel. I know that's a lot of information. Do you have any questions about using the chlorhexidine scrub? \n\n Patient: No. No. \n\n Nurse: Okay, Ms. Kapoor. Just to reiterate, you'll need to use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure. Can you remember to do that? \n\n Patient: Yes. I can. \n\n Nurse: That's great, Ms. Kapoor. Now, let's discuss when to stop eating and drinking before your procedure. You cannot eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. This is very important for your safety during the procedure. Do you have any questions about this? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Okay then, Ms. Kapoor. I'm glad to hear that. I know I've shared a lot of information with you, but we're almost done. I just have a couple more questions for you. Before we continue, do you have any questions or is there anything you'd like to discuss? \n\n Patient: Not that I can think of. \n\n Nurse: Alrighty then -- Ms. Kapoor. Let's move on then. I'd like to ask if you've noticed any signs of illness recently. Have you had a fever, chills, or muscle aches? \n\n Patient: No. I haven't. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear, Ms. Kapoor. It's essential that you're in good health before your procedure. Now, I'd like to confirm your discharge plan. After your procedure, the current plan is for you to go home. Is that still correct? \n\n Patient: Yes. But If if I'm not doing well, would they hold me up a hospital longer? \n\n Nurse: Yes, Ms. Kapoor. Your safety and well-being are our top priorities. If your medical team feels that you need to stay in the hospital longer for your recovery, they will certainly make that recommendation. However, the goal is always to get you home and back to your normal routine as soon as it's safe to do so. Does that answer your question? \n\n Patient: Yeah. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that, Ms. Kapoor. Now, the last question I have for you today is about your transportation and support at home. Have you arranged for a ride home and for someone to stay with you after the procedure? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: That's excellent, Ms. Kapoor. Having someone to help you out after the procedure can make a big difference in your recovery. Who will be there to support you? \n\n Patient: Missus Stokes? Patient: I said my sister \n\n\n <<SYS>> <TASK>The patient is trying to pronounce a medication. They said: missus stokes. Try to determine what medications they are referring to. Consider suggesting drugs from the following list:\n\n1. maxidex\n2. omacetaxine\n3. cedax\n\nIf none of the suggestions are what the patient is trying to pronounce, then ask the patient for more information such as the spelling or the color or shape of the drug.</TASK><</SYS>>\n\n\n Nurse: I'm sorry, Ms. Kapoor. I misunderstood. You said your sister will be there to support you. That's wonderful. Having a family member around can be very comforting. Does your sister live nearby? \n\n Patient: Okay. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that your sister will be there to support you, Ms. Kapoor. It's essential to have someone around after a procedure like this. Now, that was all the topics for today. Do you have any other questions or concerns that you'd like to discuss? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Okay, Ms. Kapoor. Just to summarize, before your procedure, you need to stop taking Advil at least 24 hours before surgery, use the chlorhexidine scrub the night before and the morning of your procedure, and remember not to eat or drink anything after midnight before your procedure. Can I count on you to do all of this? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: ",
