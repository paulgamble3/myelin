Is this David Rosen? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: Great, I'm calling on behalf of Dr. Robert Friedman, your Surgeon. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth? \n\n Patient: January first nineteen eighty. \n\n Nurse: Thanks for confirming that. I'm your AI Post-Discharge Specialist. Dr. Friedman asked me to check in on you after your discharge from the hospital. How are you doing today? \n\n Patient: Fine. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Being back home must be a relief after your stay in the hospital. Is there anything specific you're looking forward to doing? \n\n Patient: Just resting. \n\n Nurse: Rest is indeed essential for recovery. Do you have a favorite book or TV show that you enjoy while resting? \n\n Patient: Only murders in the building. \n\n Nurse: That's a good show! It must be nice to catch up on it while you're resting. I'm calling to check on how you're doing with your new medications. Do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address before we go over them? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Alright. Let's start with your new prescriptions. Have you been able to pick up your Tylenol 500 mg tablets from the pharmacy? \n\n Patient: Yes. But it's just normal Tylenol. Right? So some special Tylenol that I only have to get from the pharmacy. \n\n Nurse: Yes, you're correct. The Tylenol you've been prescribed is the same as the over-the-counter Tylenol. However, the dosage you're taking is specific to your needs after surgery. Are you taking it as prescribed, which is 1000 mg three times a day as needed? \n\n Patient: Yes. If I I don't need it, is it okay that I don't take it at all? \n\n Nurse: Absolutely, the Tylenol is there for you to manage your pain. If you're not experiencing pain, you don't need to take it. However, if you start to feel discomfort, it's there for you. Let's move on to the next medication. Have you picked up your Tramadex 100 mg tablets? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking the Tramadex as prescribed, which is 100 mg once a day? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: That's excellent. It's critical to take Tramadex as prescribed to manage your pain effectively. Let's talk about your existing medications. Are you still taking Gabapentin and Advil? \n\n Patient: Yeah. But I shouldn't need to take Advil if I'm taking eyelenol. They're like the same thing. Right? \n\n Nurse: ",

        "G15": "Actually, Tylenol and Advil are different types of pain relievers. Tylenol is an analgesic, which means it relieves pain. Advil is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, which helps reduce inflammation. Both are important for managing your pain and inflammation after surgery. Are you taking the Advil as prescribed, which is 300 mg three times a day as needed?",
        "G15DPO": "You're correct in that both Tylenol and Advil can help manage pain. However, they work in different ways and are often used together to provide more effective pain relief. This is especially important after a major surgery like your knee replacement. Does that make sense?",
        "gpt4": "Just to make sure I heard you correctly, are you saying that you're not taking Advil because you're already taking Tylenol?"
