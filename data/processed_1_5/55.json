What is Evernow? \n\n Nurse: Great, I'm calling on behalf of Evernow. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth? \n\n Patient: Before I share my date of birth, I need to know who you're where you're calling from. \n\n Nurse: I apologize for any confusion.

We help monitor your health and communicate any important information back to your doctor. Can you please provide your date of birth for verification purposes? \n\n Patient: Okay. Sure. January first nineteen seventy. \n\n Nurse: Thanks for confirming that. I'm your AI Menopause Specialist. Evernow asked me to check in on how you're doing with your new medications. How are you doing today? \n\n Patient: Doing fine. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad to hear that. Do you have about 15 minutes for a quick check-in? \n\n Patient: Sure. I have time for a quick checking. \n\n Nurse: Perfect, thank you. Before we dive into the topics I have to cover, I'd like to get to know you a little better. Is there anything you're looking forward to doing this week? \n\n Patient: I don't have anything particular coming up this week that \n\n Nurse: That's perfectly fine. Sometimes, it's nice to have a quiet week. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you enjoy doing in your free time? \n\n Patient: Yeah. Enjoy painting. \n\n Nurse: That's wonderful! Painting can be such a therapeutic activity.

Nature and landscapes can be so inspiring. Do you have a favorite place or type of landscape that you like to paint? For example, do you prefer painting forests, mountains, or maybe seascapes? \n\n Patient: I'll do all of them. Each one is a different challenge. \n\n Nurse: That's a wonderful perspective, embracing the challenge each landscape brings. It must be very rewarding to see your finished pieces. Now, before we move on to discuss your new medications, do you have any questions or concerns you'd like to address? \n\n Patient: No. \n\n Nurse: Alrighty then -- I see that you were recently prescribed new medications: Vaginal Estradiol Tablet, Progesterone, and Minoxidil. Have you been able to pick up or receive these medications? \n\n Patient: Yeah. I picked them up, but I'm not really sure about the directions for the vaginal estradiol. \n\n Nurse: Got it -- Let's go over the instructions for the Vaginal Estradiol Tablet. During the first two weeks of your treatment, you will place the tablet every night immediately before bed. After this 2-week \u201cloading dose\u201d, you will only use the medication 2 nights a week. Does that help clarify the instructions for you? \n\n Patient: How do I insert the tablet? \n\n Nurse: The vaginal estradiol tablet is typically inserted with an applicator. Here's a general step-by-step guide: Wash your hands thoroughly. Remove the tablet from its packaging and place it into the applicator as instructed by the packaging or your pharmacist. Find a comfortable position. This could be standing with one foot raised on a chair, sitting on the edge of a chair, or lying down with your knees bent and legs apart. Hold the applicator containing the tablet by the opposite end from where the tablet is. Gently insert the applicator into your vagina as far as it will comfortably go. You can use a small amount of water-based lubricant to help if needed. Push the plunger of the applicator to release the tablet. Gently remove the applicator. Wash the applicator with warm soapy water, rinse it, and let it air dry. Remember, it's best to insert the tablet right before you go to bed. This helps keep the tablet in place and gives it time to dissolve. Is that clear? \n\n Patient: So it's basically, like, inserting a tampon. The same concept. \n\n Nurse: ",
    "responses": {
        "G15": "Yes, you could say that. The process is similar to inserting a tampon, but the applicator for the tablet is a bit different. It's designed to help you place the tablet comfortably and accurately. Do you have any other questions about the Vaginal Estradiol Tablet?",
        "G15DPO": "Yes, that's a good way to think of it. The applicator is similar in size and shape to a tampon applicator, so if you've used tampons before, it should feel familiar.",
        "gpt4": "Yes, the concept is similar to inserting a tampon. Now, let's move on to the next medication. You were also prescribed Progesterone 200 Mg Oral Capsule. The dosage for this is 200 mg once a day at bedtime. Have you started taking this medication?"
