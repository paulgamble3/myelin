Is this Miriam Hoffman? \n\n Patient: Yes. \n\n Nurse: Great, I'm calling on behalf of Dr. Robert Friedman, your Cardiologist. -- To protect your privacy, can you please share your date of birth? \n\n Patient: January first nineteen sixty. \n\n Nurse: Thanks for confirming that. I'm your AI Post-Discharge Specialist. Dr. Friedman asked me to check in on you after your discharge from the hospital. How are you doing today? \n\n Patient: I'm feeling really good. \n\n Nurse: That's wonderful to hear, Ms. Hoffman. Being back home must be a relief after your time in the hospital. Is there something specific you've been looking forward to doing since you got home? \n\n Patient: Celebrating Christmas We do Christmas eve dinner with the family. We do the Italian feast of seven fishes. \n\n Nurse: That sounds like a lovely tradition, Ms. Hoffman. Do you have a favorite dish from the feast of seven fishes? Also, I wanted to discuss your new medications. Do you have any questions or concerns about them before we dive in? \n\n Patient: No. I I wanted to ask a different question. Gen. Can I participate in cardiac rehabilitation? And how could that benefit my overall heart health? \n\n Nurse: Yes, participating in cardiac rehabilitation can be very beneficial. It can help improve your heart's physical function and aid in lifestyle changes like diet and exercise. It's a supervised program that can help reduce the risk of future heart problems. \n\n Patient: Is that something that is offered by my health care team? Can I go to a local hospital for that? How would I find it? \n\n Nurse: Yes, cardiac rehabilitation is typically offered by your healthcare team. You can inquire about it at Sheba Medical Center or a local hospital. They can guide you on how to find a suitable program. \n\n Patient: Perfect. Thank you so much. \n\n Nurse: You're welcome, Ms. Hoffman. Let's move on to your new medications. Have you been able to pick up your Tensopril 5 mg oral tablet from the pharmacy? \n\n Patient: Yes. I actually had it delivered along with the other new medication. \n\n Nurse: That's good to hear. Are you taking the Tensopril 5 mg tablet as prescribed, which is 10 mg daily? \n\n Patient: Yes. I am. \n\n Nurse: That's excellent. And how about the Fusid 20 mg oral tablet? Are you taking it as prescribed, which is 20 mg twice a day? \n\n Patient: Yes. Once in the morning and once at night. \n\n Nurse: That's perfect, you're doing a good job. Since you don't have any existing medications, we can move on. Sometimes, people find it challenging to take their medications on time. Do you ever have trouble remembering to take your medication? \n\n Patient: I haven't yet. I have a reminder, so it on my phone just in case. But with only two medications, it's pretty easy so far. \n\n Nurse: That's a smart strategy, using a reminder on your phone. It seems like you're managing your medications well. Since you've been discharged, have you noticed any new health concerns or changes in your condition? \n\n Patient: No. Everything seems to be going along well. I wanted to ask, are there any restrictions with these new medications as far as alcohol goes? \n\n Nurse: Yes, there are restrictions. Both Tensopril and Fusid can interact with alcohol, potentially causing dizziness and a drop in blood pressure. It's best to avoid alcohol while taking these medications. \n\n Patient: I see. So I can't even have, like, a drink of wine on Christmas Eve? \n\n Nurse: While a small amount of alcohol may not cause a severe reaction, it's generally safer to avoid it altogether while on these medications. However, if you wish to have a drink on Christmas Eve, please limit it to a small amount and monitor your body's reaction. \n\n Patient: Thank you. \n\n Nurse: You're welcome, Ms. Hoffman. I'll make sure to inform Doctor Friedman about our conversation and how well you're doing with your medications. Do you have any other questions or concerns you'd like to discuss? \n\n Patient: I don't think so. I think you've answered all of my concerns. \n\n Nurse: I'm glad I could help. To summarize, you're doing well with your new medications, Tensopril and Fusid, and you're aware of the potential interaction with alcohol. You're also interested in cardiac rehabilitation, which can be beneficial for your heart health. I'll pass this information to Doctor Friedman. Thank you for your time, and enjoy your Christmas Eve dinner. If you need anything, don't hesitate to reach out to Sheba Medical Center. \n\n Patient: Rachel, so I'm planning on going on a cruise in the New Year.
